Cape Town – A truck came under attack on the N1 before the weighbridge in the direction of Worcester on Wednesday morning and was set alight. The burnt-out truck is still obstructing the lane heading to Worcester and Rawsonville at the Du Toitskloof Pass exit, though vehicles travelling to Cape Town aren't affected. According to Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa, three armed men forced the driver out of the truck before torching the vehicle with a petrol bomb. The truck driver drove over stones that had been laid on the road, forcing him to stop and then ordering him out of the vehicle, said Africa. They then left the scene in an Opel Corsa without number plates, heading towards Cape Town.. There have been a number of attacks directed at truck drivers recently, many of whom are foreigners, which seemed to be motivated by xenophobia. Parliament's Select Committee on Trade and Industry said it was engaging with the Department of Labour and Employment to find solutions to address the attacks on truck drivers, EWN reported. Chairperson Mandla Rayi this was not only a crime against truck drivers but also against the economy.
