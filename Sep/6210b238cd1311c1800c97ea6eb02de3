Cape Town â€“ Ten people had to be taken to hospital after a gas leak at a Muizenberg high school on Thursday morning. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said they had responded to the gas leak just after 11am, after liquid chlorine thrown into a blocked drain caused a vapour cloud to spread through the corridors of the school. Two fire engines, two rescue vehicles and various ambulance services assisted in treating the 23 people who were affected the most. "Information we have at the moment indicates liquid chlorine was thrown into a blocked drain inside the male ablution facility. "This resulted in a vapour cloud forming, which spread through the corridors of the school," Carelse said "Approximately 23 persons (students and teachers) were affected and treated for respiratory distress. "Ten patients have been taken to hospital for further treatment and the blocked drain has been cleared." Cape Times
