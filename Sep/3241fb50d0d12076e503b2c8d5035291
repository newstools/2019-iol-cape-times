Hailing from the Eastern Cape, Ondele Bede and Mihlali Stofile of Holy Cross High School, as well as Okhela Sigwela and Lizalise Dhlomo of Hudson High School, argued their way through quarter and semi-final rounds, before yesterday being asked questions by the justices, to take home the first place title. Deputy Justice Minister John Jeffery said: “The Schools Moot Court presents a unique opportunity for pupils to examine and scrutinise the Constitution and face hypothetical situations which test real world cases, and pushes them to their limit. “Many will dream of being lawyers, many will train and be mentored, but the reality is only a handful will ever make it. You as finalists in this prestigious competition have done much to achieve those dreams.” Hosted by the Basic Education Department and the SA Human Rights Commission, participating pupils were required to prepare an essay on a fictional Constitutional Court case, as both applicants and respondents. The 2019 hypothetical problem looked at a case involving a pupil’s right to wear her natural dreadlocks in a manner she perceived as neat, versus her Christian school’s code of conduct, which stated pupils might only wear their natural hair for religious purposes as per the schools values. Since its inception in 2011, the National Schools Moot Court competition has explored the Bill of Rights. The competition offers a platform for young people to experiment with the application of constitutional law. Cape Times
