Cape Town â€“ Four trucks have been petrol-bombed on the N7 in the Western Cape in separate incidents within minutes of each other early on Tuesday. According to Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa, a truck loaded with cement was petrol-bombed and set alight just after midnight near Moorreesburg. The truck had been forced off the road by two vehicles and then set alight, completely gutting it. Minutes later another truck was petrol-bombed at the Porterville turn-off. The truck driver was seriously wounded in the attack after he had pulled off the road to get some shut-eye. The fourth truck attack happened at 2am when a truck transporting chicken was set alight near Piekenierskloof. The driver was doused with petrol but escaped unharmed. He said the police were still investigating all four cases. Last week, the ministers of Employment and Labour, Police, Transport and Home Affairs noted that incidents against drivers and their vehicles were turning more violent and criminal. The ministers condemned the ongoing violence, claiming it was "economic sabotage threatening the economic viability of the SADC region".     Cape Times
