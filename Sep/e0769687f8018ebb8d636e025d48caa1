Cape Town – The N2 incoming left lane is still closed between the M9 at Macassar and Baden Powell Drive due to a cash-in-transit heist that took place last night, but the right lane has been opened. According to Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa, the N2 inbound has been affected since 10pm on Monday after the incident occurred at the Kramat Road bridge. Motorists travelling from Strand and Somerset West were advised to use alternative routes such as the R102, the Eersterivier Road, then rejoining the N2 at Baden Powell Drive. Three vehicles were involved in the incident and a shootout ensued between the suspects and police, Africa said. Western Cape Gangwatch reported that a suspect was arrested. The City of Cape Town said earlier police are still busy with their investigation and the Fidelity vehicle targeted was still on the scene. They were unsure when the N2 would be flowing freely again. Meanwhile, Africa said it’s unclear at this stage if the setting alight of a truck on the N7 near Cape Town was related to a nationwide protest by truck drivers. The truck was set alight near the Atlantis turn-off on Monday night. The road was closed in both directions but has since been reopened. Cape Times
