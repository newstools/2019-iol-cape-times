In a statement the department said: “The Department of Home Affairs has noted messages on social media saying there are people pretending to be Home Affairs officials only to rob people once they have gained access to their homes. “The message alleges that they are carrying letterheads purportedly from the department.” But the department said it had not received any complaints of this nature from members of the public. It advised people who are aware of such activity, depending on its veracity, to report it to the police. “We reiterate our message that Home Affairs officials do not and will not come to your homes to validate IDs,” said acting Home Affairs director-general Thulani Mavuso.
