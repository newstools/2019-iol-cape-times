The suspect had arrived at the enquiry counter, with the intention of applying for a driver’s license, but the staff member who assisted him noticed a discrepancy on the learner license document. A check on the Natis system confirmed that the person was not in possession of a valid learner’s license. He was arrested and detained at Atlantis SAPS. Cape Argus
