Cape Town – Two women and a baby were killed after a collision between a light motor vehicle and a bakkie on the N1 near Cape Town early on Monday. According to Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa, the driver of a Toyota Hilux bakkie was detained for alleged drunk driving just after midnight by Kraaifontein police officers.
