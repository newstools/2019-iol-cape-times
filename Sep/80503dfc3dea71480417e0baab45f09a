Cape Town – A southern suburbs high school took immediate action after a pupil posted a video telling a rape joke on social media. Questioned on whether a Wynberg Boys High pupil was facing disciplinary action over the issue, Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said: "The comment made over the weekend was completely inappropriate and offensive, as well as concerning, given the current focus on (gender-based) violence in this country. "The school took immediate action after they were informed of the post. The learner has already faced an internal disciplinary inquiry and has shown remorse. "The learner, parents and school have come to an agreement on the corrective measures going forward." The inappropriate video was posted at a time when protests against gender-based violence have reached fever pitch. South Africans are insisting on harsher punishment for perpetrators and action from the government, which President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised. The Crime Against Women in South Africa Report by Statistics SA shows that femicide in the country is five times higher than the global average. A total of 41% of people raped are children and only one in nine rape cases are reported. Of those reported, only 4% result in prosecution.
