The officers, aged 54 and 49, were wounded during the robbery and died from their injuries in hospital. “In pursuit of suspects responsible for the ruthless murder of two law enforcement in Browns Farm, provincial detectives, supported by integrated forces attached to Operation Lockdown, conducted a multi-disciplinary operation in the area. “This operation led to the arrest of four male suspects, aged between 19 and 33, and a female suspect, aged 23, for being in possession of four firearms comprising three glocks and a norinco, five magazines and 45 rounds of ammunition in Ramaphosa informal settlement. "Two of the glocks were identified as the ones stolen from the slain law enforcement officers,” said police spokesperson Andrè Traut. He said the suspects were detained for the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition and were due to appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court once they have been charged. Plato said: "I condemn this heartless act and am calling on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to find these perpetrators and make sure they feel the full might of the law.
