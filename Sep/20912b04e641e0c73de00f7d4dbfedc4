Cape Town – A total of 21 people will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday regarding incidents related to the protests against gender-based violence in the CBD the past two days. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut said eight people were arrested for public violence and two for assault on a police officer on Thursday. "They are due to make their court appearances on Monday in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, together with the 11 who were arrested on Wednesday," Traut said. On Wednesday, eight female and two male students were arrested on charges of public violence. Aside from tens of thousands of people protesting outside the gates of Parliament on Thursday and a march to the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC), where the World Economic Forum on Africa is being held, pupils across the Cape metropole formed human chains over the raping and killing of women and girls. There were accusations of police being heavyhanded in their approach towards protesters outside the CTICC, with a water cannon being used to disperse people for the second day in a row. On Wednesday, stun grenades were also used. Cape Times
