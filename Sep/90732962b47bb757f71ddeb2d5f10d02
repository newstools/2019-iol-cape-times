When asked whether cabinet would consider a discussion on referendum following calls for the reinstatement of the death penalty, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola said if the matter was brought to cabinet, it would probably have to be discussed. Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali said: “We need to reflect back and address the issues to the society. We need to interrogate the psychological side of our society.” “The violence has been happening for a very long time in South Africa – 3 915 women were murdered last year and if it was not a wake-up call for us, I just don’t know. "The issues are not bound by race, gender, geographical area. As a community we need to unite and do things for ourselves such as educating men in our community on how to behave and how to treat a woman.” Meanwhile, police have launched a search for 12-year-old Shariefa Adams who went missing in Robertson on August 30. She was last seen on her way to a shop in the area. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a nightgown.
