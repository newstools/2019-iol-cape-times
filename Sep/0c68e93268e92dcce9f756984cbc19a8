Facebook public policy manager Emilar Gandhi said that as a global online community, keeping people safe on their apps is incredibly important. She said they worked with experts from around the world to inform their policies, practices and products supporting those at risk of suicide or self-injury. “We tightened our policy around self-harm to no longer allow graphic cutting images to avoid unintentionally promoting or triggering self-harm, even when someone is seeking support or expressing themselves to aid their recovery. “On Instagram, we’ve also made it harder to search for this type of content and kept it from being recommended. We’ve also taken steps to address the complex issue of eating disorder content on our apps by tightening our policy to prohibit additional content that may promote eating disorders,” she said. They also partnered with Digify Africa for a programme called Ilizwe Lam aimed at training teens on the importance of internet safety, Gandhi said. Digify Africa chief operating officer Qhakaza Mthembu said:“The internet can be a lovely place filled with opportunity, but it also has its dark side. The most vulnerable to this dark side are teenagers who can be easily manipulated and duped. That is why we have partnered with Facebook to run an internet safety campaign.” mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.za Cape Argus
