Cape Town – The dams supplying the Cape Town metro are almost 82% full (81.9%), the City said on Monday. Collective water consumption for the past week has increased to 598 million litres per day. This is 30 million litres per day more than last week, but still well within the target of 650 million litres per day. "Residents are evidently still mindful that fuller dams do not necessarily mean water scarcity is a thing of the past as consumption levels indicate ongoing water savings efforts. "This winter we have again received lower than average rainfall (so far) and as such the City plans to maintain current level 1 water restrictions and tariffs for the moment. "This will be reassessed at a meeting of all users of the Western Cape Water supply system around November this year," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Waste, Xanthea Limberg.
