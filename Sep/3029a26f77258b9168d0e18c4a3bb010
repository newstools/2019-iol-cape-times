In an effort to acknowledge and recognise the significant impact of women in the informal trading sector, the City’s urban management directorate hosted 150 women, from approximately 30 associations, at an informal trading seminar in Parow last week. “Geographically, much of the informal sector population comprises marginalised and historically disadvantaged groups and are well represented among street traders,” said Mayco member for urban management Grant Twigg. “Similarly, the role of women in street trade is significant, not only due to the prevailing number of women that engage in street trade but because of their noteworthy economic contributions and position as a vulnerable group.” Keynote topics at the seminar included: clothing manufacturing in the informal economy; poverty, waste pickers and day labourers in the informal economy; why waste is not rubbish and opportunities in recycling; and women leading in the informal trading sector. “This city-wide event was the first of its kind and celebrated women in informal trading, their contribution and the impact they make in their local communities,” said Twigg. “This past month has seen the demise of so many women in our beautiful city and we need to acknowledge that women are the backbone of our society.”
