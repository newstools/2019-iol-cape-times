Cape Town – The Anti-Gang Unit is offering a R10 000 reward for information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects responsible for the murder of Sergeant Donovan Prins in Lavender Hill. Prins, 34, a member of the Crime Prevention Unit at Steenberg police station, was on patrol in Fawley Court on June 24, where the Mongrels and Corner Boys gangs had been involved in a shootout.
