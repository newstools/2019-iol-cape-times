CapeNature said it confronted challenges brought about by climate change such as drought and extinction. CapeNature executive director for conservation operations Ernst Baard said: “In the short term, water saving and water conservation campaigns need to continue as part of our engagement with visitors, neighbours, communities and partners. “The message needs to be communicated as part of a focused media campaign and verbal engagements with stakeholders. The public and our communities should continuously be informed about the role and importance of water in sustaining life and the economy of the region.” The organisation is also implementing local level adaptation and mitigation measures. These include disaster risk reduction though protecting key ecological infrastructure such as wetlands and riparian corridors. “A wide range of interventions include the provision of green jobs, the rollout of advocacy and awareness programmes and high-level input to provincial and national environmental legislation,” CapeNature said.
