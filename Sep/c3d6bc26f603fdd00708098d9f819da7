The Two Oceans Aquarium, with the support of The Beach Co-op, will be at Monwabisi Beach, Khayelitsha, to not only take part in the event, but to also host the next in its Trash Bash clean-up series. Last year, more than 1 million volunteers took part and collected about 10 million kilograms of trash. Cigarette butts came out tops, with 5.7 million collected, followed by food wrappers at 3.7 million and straws and stirrers at 3.6 million. “Anyone who’s spent a morning on a beach to pick up plastic pollution knows that it’s actually a chance to have a ball, spend time with friends and family, to breathe some fresh air and to feel the sand between your toes, and to then go home a slightly better, slightly more informed person,” the aquarium said. Started 30 years ago in Texas in the US, International Coastal Clean-up Day has grown to include more than 100 countries. Cape Times
