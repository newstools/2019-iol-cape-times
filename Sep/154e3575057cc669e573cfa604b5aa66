I was horrified and called the police,” the distraught woman said. Emotions She said police soon arrived and cordoned off the scene. “I just had a baby a few weeks ago, so my emotions are still very high. How could someone be so callous as to throw a child away. It is very, very sad.” Police spokesperson, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana, says: “A death inquest case has been opened for investigation following the discovery of a foetus at the corner of Weltevreden and Varkensvlei Road, Philippi.” Anyone who can shed light on the incident can call investigation officer Detective Sergeant Xolani Basso at 078 319 6745 or 021 690 1517 or Crime Stop at 0800 10111. saafia.february@inl.co.za Daily Voice
