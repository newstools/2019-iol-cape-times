Cape Town – Vandals have caused extensive damage to rail infrastructure at Maitland over the weekend, Metrorail said on Monday. This means train cancellations and route deviations can be expected, contributing to the extended running times of trains. There has been a temporary suspension of the service on the Central line. The damaged infrastructure impacts the regional train service train service as follows, Metrorail said: "There are route deviations on the Northern line – Wellington/Kraaifontein trains operate via Monte Vista and Strand/Muldersvlei trains operate via Salt River. "A pantograph hook-up at Bontheuwel necessitated the suspension of the Central line service until further notice. "As a result, there is no overhead power supply to both lines, resulting in train movement temporarily halted until the technical teams can repair the overhead electrical equipment damaged during the incident. "Metrorail condemns this act of vandalism in the strongest possible terms. The growing element of cable theft and vandalism of critical infrastructure components, which results in dysfunctional signals and track circuits, rendering the system temporarily dysfunctional, is deplorable." Commuters have been encouraged to heed public address announcements at stations, to consult Metrorail's passenger information channels and their phones, if registered to receive service alerts, and to share the information with fellow commuters.
