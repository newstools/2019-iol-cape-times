Cape Town – One person died in a fire in Strand this morning. According to the City's Fire and Rescue spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse, firefighters responded to informal structures that were alight in Mxolisi Street in Nomzamo, Strand, at about 00.40am. A total of seven firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 31 staff members battled for more than four hours to extinguish the blaze, Carelse said. The fire was finally extinguished at 4.52am. A firefighter sustained smoke inhalation and was treated on the scene by medical personnel. "Whilst busy clearing the debris, a body, gender and age unknown, was discovered to have sustained fatal burn wounds," Carelse said. "A firefighter also suffered from smoke inhalation and was treated by medical personnel. The scene was handed over to the South African Police Service." The incident, among others, have highlighted the plight of Cape Town firefighters, who handed over a memorandum of demands to the Department of Labour last week. Firefighters said they work 24-hour shifts but were being paid for less than half of the time worked. They marched to Parliament after taking their protest to the Civic Centre on Thursday. They claim the City of Cape Town does not pay them overtime, even though they work 24-hour shifts. The SA Municipal Workers Union said if the City did not give in to members’ demands before the end of the month, they would work only eight-hour shifts. Cape Times
