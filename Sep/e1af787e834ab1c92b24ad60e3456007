Three firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 14 staff were dispatched. "The officer of the first arriving appliance found a semi-detached dwelling alight and was informed that one person was unaccounted for. "A subsequent search of the property led to the discovery of the body of a 77-year-old elderly female, (who) had been overcome by smoke.
