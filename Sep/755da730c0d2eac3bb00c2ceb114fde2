Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said: “In an effort to root out corruption and investigate criminal elements as set out by our constitutional mandate, the Hawks Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team descended on the Laingsburg municipal offices carrying out a search and seizure operation yesterday (Tuesday). “This was undertaken at the municipal offices as well as private homes of the people of interest. Documents, cellphones, laptops and hard drives were seized for further investigation.” The raids came after allegations regarding the contravention of the Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 and the Prevention and Combat of Corrupt Activities Act 12 of 2004, relating to the appointment and removal of personnel to key strategic positions. This alleged corruption reportedly paved the way to continue a culture of misappropriation of public funds. No arrests have been made at this stage, pending the on-going investigation. The municipality did not respond to questions by deadline. The DA in the province welcomed the raid, with constituency head for Laingsburg Deidre Baartman saying the party would monitor the progress of the investigation carefully and provide full co-operation to bring stability and good governance to Laingsburg.
