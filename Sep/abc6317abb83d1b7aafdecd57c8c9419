Cape Town – Parow residents have launched a fundraising campaign to hire a well-known private investigator to investigate the murder of UWC student Jesse Hess, 19, and her 85-year-old grandfather, Chris Lategan. Hess’s body was found on her bed while Lategan was reportedly found tied up in the toilet in their Parow flat on August 30. To date no arrests have been made, and police said they were following all possible leads. Fundraising initiator Kate Steyn said Noel Pratten, who was hired for the case of slain UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana and horse rider Meghan Cremer, has agreed to take on the case relating to Hess and Lategan. Three people were arrested for killing Cremer at a Philippi farm, while a post office employee was arrested for raping and killing Mrwetyana. “As a community, we are all shocked and outraged by this crime, as much as we were by the murderers of Megan Cremer and Uyinene Mrwetyana and wish to see justice served for Jesse, Pa Chris and their family. "The common thread in solving both these crimes was the appointment of Noel Pratten who cracked both cases. All funds raised will go directly to paying Pratten,” said Steyn. A fund-raising drive on Backabuddy had so far raised close to R5 000. Cape Times
