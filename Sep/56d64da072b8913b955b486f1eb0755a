Cape Town â€“ Law Enforcement officers patrolling in the Bonteheuwel area on Sunday ended up rushing a man who had been shot in his BMW to hospital after being flagged down by a resident. At 7pm in Bonteheuwel Avenue, the officers were informed that a shooting was taking place, the City said on Monday. The officers made their way to Smalblaar Road when they noticed a blue/grey BMW behind them flashing its headlights constantly and hooting. "The officers stopped to investigate and as they got out of their vehicle, they saw approximately four bullet holes in the front windscreen," the City said. "The driver climbed out of his vehicle and told the officers he was shot and wounded in his chest and arm. "The victim begged the officers to take him to hospital as he did not want to wait for an ambulance. "They rushed him to the Bonteheuwel Day Hospital in their official vehicle as the man was petrified of bleeding to death. "The officers dropped him off at the hospital. His condition was serious. The man's attackers were not found." Cape Times
