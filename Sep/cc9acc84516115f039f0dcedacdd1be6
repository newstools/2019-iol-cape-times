Cape Town  – The water levels of dams supplying Cape Town stand at 81.7 percent, which is about 10 percent higher than at the comparative stage last year. The Berg River and Steenbras Lower dams are almost 100 percent full, while Cape Town's main supply dam, Theewaterskloof, is at 72 percent. The Wemmershoek, Steenbras Upper and Voelvlei dams are also more than 85 percent full. The City has reiterated its call for consumers to use water sparingly. The hydrological cycle only ends in October, when a decision will be made on whether to ease water restrictions, but this is unlikely to happen if dams are not at least 85 to 90 percent full. Looking at the dams supplying Cape Town, in September 2017 the Berg River dam level stood at 63.8 percent, Steenbras Lower at 46.3 percent, Steenbras Upper 99.9 percent, Theewaterskloof 28.4 percent, Voelvlei 26.7 percent and Wemmershoek 44.4 percent.
