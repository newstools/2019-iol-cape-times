The 26-year-old said working in a male-dominated field there were times she wanted to give up, but her drive and passion kept her going. “My body sometimes aches after a strenuous job, but it comes with the trade. What I’ve learned is that when you love what you do, every challenge is an opportunity to grow. "My stature and physical strength have always been my biggest challenge in this field.” Pedro matriculated from Spes Bona Technical High School in 2010, then studied engineering sciences, during which she was exposed to steelwork. She also studied multi-disciplinary drawing. “Once I became enrolled in an apprenticeship programme, the training officer for shipping at that time, Mr Rafeeq Fisher, who has been my father figure throughout the apprenticeship and the forerunner of fighting to get me qualified, insisted I pursue this trade. "I do not regret my decision, now that I am finally a qualified shipbuilder and the first female shipbuilder in South Africa. ‘‘I wouldn’t say I know everything, but I’m willing to absorb everything this trade has to offer. I truly look up to each artisan, training officer, and each person I have been blessed to work alongside. "They have taught me there is always a way to get the job done, regardless of stature or strength. There are always other tools to choose from within the measurements of our own capabilities. "We can do more than our shortcomings would have us believe.” Cape Times
