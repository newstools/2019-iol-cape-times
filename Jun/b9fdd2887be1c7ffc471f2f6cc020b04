Police said the suspect, who is from Philippi East, is a learner at the school. During a search of his house, six cellphone covers, believed to have been stolen during the robbery, were found. “He was identified by means of surveillance footage at the school, when he and his accomplices entered the classroom at around 10.10am while learners were writing exams,” police spokesperson Andrè Traut said. “The teacher and learners were held at gunpoint and robbed of a number of cellphones.” During the incident, the teacher sustained an injury to her face. Meanwhile, the provincial Education Department’s specialised support directorate dispatched a counsellor and psychologist on site for learners who required support and counselling. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said last week that she was “concerned that criminals have become so brazen that they enter school premises on a busy road, in broad day light”. She was shocked that not even a strong security presence or CCTV cameras could stop the suspects. The suspect is due to make his court appearance in Cape Town today. CAPE TIMES
