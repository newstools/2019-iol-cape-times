Cape Town – Accused child killer Melvin Volkwyn will on Wednesday hear the outcome of his bail application after having applied for it shortly after his arrest in April. Volkwyn, 40, is accused of murdering 20-month-old Orderick Lucas from Eerste River after kidnapping him. He also faces a charge of defeating the administration of justice. Volkwyn had previously cited threats of sexual harassment and assault while being kept in custody, but the State has opposed bail. He is facing a schedule 5 offence with the State citing Volkwyn’s previous offences for “petty crimes” - theft and drug possession - which he evaded trial for and lied about his address and name to authorities, to oppose bail. The State also called for petitions submitted to the court be dismissed after it emerged signatures on both had been forged. The body of Orderick was discovered in a stormwater drain in Wittebol Street, Melton Rose, Eerste River after he was reported missing on March 24. He was found just metres away from his grandmother Cornelia Scheepers’ home on April 2 after a child tried to fetch a ball that had rolled into the drain. According to the State’s interpretation of evidence received, Volkwyn was seen carrying a suitcase he appeared to be “struggling with” hours before Orderick’s body was found. Cape Times
