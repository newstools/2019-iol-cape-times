Cape Town â€“ Another cold front is set to hit the Western Cape on Sunday afternoon, bringing gale-force winds and more rain than was the case on Thursday and this morning. SA Weather Service forecaster Mbahvi Maliage told the Cape Times a heavy downpour is expected on Sunday through to Monday, which will clear in the morning. The weather is not expected to be as extreme as last weekend, but it will be icy and lead to localised flooding. Charlotte Powell, of the City's Disaster Risk Management Centre, said "no major incidents related to last night's rain and wind has been reported to the disaster operations centre". A heavy downpour is expected between Saldanha and Cape Point from around 3pm on Sunday, with the cold front bringing snow on Monday evening over the Western Cape. Another cold front is expected to bring rain on Tuesday, but Maliage said it's still too early to accurately predict its intensity. The total rainfall in the catchment areas on Thursday and today was reportedly around 15mm, but Sunday and Monday's rain will boost dams in the Western Cape even more, possibly rising to over 30mm.
