Huguenot Primary teacher Heinrich Gabler was a top 14 finalist in the 2017 edition, and decided to give this year’s competition a shot, beating out first prince Shaun Stander and second prince Bhekuzinde Nobunga for the win.     It still hasn't sunk in yet 😱❤️🎉 I'm really honoured to be the @mr.southafrica_official of 2019! #teamgabler #dreamchaser #blackieexcellence⚜ 📸 @dionnejordaanphotography A post shared by  Heinrich Gabby Gabler (@gablerheinrich) on Jun 10, 2019 at 2:38am PDT Born in Somerset West, the 28-year- old has not had an easy upbringing, which he said proved that with a push in the right direction, dedication and talent, you could overcome your circumstances. Gabler was 9 when his mother died in a car accident. He, his older sister and two brothers were then brought to House Andrew Murray, a children’s home in Wellington. Growing up, Gabler said, he wanted to pursue a rugby career, but he put those dreams aside to become a teacher and work with children. He also developed a love for modelling, winning titles including Mr Huguenot, Mr Western Cape and Mr Winelands.     2018 you've been good 🥂 A post shared by  Heinrich Gabby Gabler (@gablerheinrich) on Dec 31, 2018 at 3:38am PST “I have a passion for children and love inspiring people to become the best version of themselves. “Winning Mr SA means the world to me, I really hope it gives the people of South Africa hope by showing that it doesn’t matter where you come from in life, what matters most is where you are heading. “It was a long, tough but amazing journey.
