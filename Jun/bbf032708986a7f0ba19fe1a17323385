With only three weeks remaining before the deadline, there are still 101 757 parents and guardians who have not indicated if their children’s applications were successful and their final choice of school, the department said. This year, the department piloted the online admissions system to deal with the increasing demand for places in schools by identifying schools that have spaces available and to encourage parents to enrol children early. Spokesperson for the WCED, Bronagh Hammond, said about 25124 parents had confirmed placement through the online system and more than 10 000 WhatsApps, with the majority being confirmations of acceptance. Admission can be checked at https://wcedonline.westerncape. gov.za/admissions-201920 If unsuccessful with the above, WhatsApp 067 973 3099 with your name and surname, cellphone number, pupil’s name and surname, Centralised Educational Management Information System number and school number (where applicable) and your school of choice according to your successful applications.
