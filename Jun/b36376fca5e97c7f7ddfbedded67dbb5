The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) had lodged an application for an urgent interdict against the DEA, and managed to conclude its arguments yesterday. Lawyers representing the NSPCA argued that the department acted “callously” in increasing the lion bone quota from 800 skeletons in 2017 to 1500 las year. NSPCA spokesperson Meg Wilson said: “We have long been actively involved in addressing the cruelty in the captive lion industry; starting with lion cubs for petting to ‘canned lion’ hunting or slaughter for lion bone, with pending cruelty cases. “We believe that there is inadequate regulation of lions’ conditions of captivity and slaughter. The study on which the quota decision was based is incomplete. “The DEA failed to comply with its statutory duty to consult and based on expert opinion and data available, consider the decision to be scientifically irrational,” Wilson said. The DEA argued that it had considered the NSPCA’s submission in the determination of the lion bone quota “but it did not carry the necessary scientific value and weight and therefore was not accepted”. The department also argued that as long as the quota was derived from lions in captivity, there was no threat to wild population. Cape Times
