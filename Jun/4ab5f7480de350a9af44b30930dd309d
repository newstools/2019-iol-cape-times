For the second year in a row, the UCT GSB improved its ranking, climbing 16 places this year. It is one of just three African business schools to make it onto this year's rankings. The director of executive education at the UCT GSB, Kumeshnee West, said: “It is a vivid testament to the work we have put in to grow and enhance our offering to clients over the years.” The UCT GSB was ranked top in Africa in terms of faculty diversity, meaning its faculty was gender representative and drew on a mix of nationalities. It also scored in the top 50 globally in terms of value for money. To participate in the annual Financial Times ranking, schools must be internationally accredited by either Equis or AACSB and have earned revenues of $2 million (R29m) during the preceding financial year. UCT GSB business development director Rayner Canning said: “This is no lightweight ranking, and bear in mind there are thousands of business schools in the world, so 51st is an impressive feat. "The UCT GSB prides itself on co-creating innovative and impactful programmes to deliver transformative learning that advances our clients business. This is an affirmation of our high-touch, client-centric approach.” Cape Times
