To change this, the institute is calling for black women to apply for two PhD fellowships and one post-doctoral fellowship, starting next year. Heri director Dr Robyn Pickering said the story of human evolution had long been told with fossils from South Africa, discovered by a privileged few. Only about 39% of science researchers in South Africa were women. “We want to disrupt this narrative by supporting South African researchers from all backgrounds and telling our origin story with a diverse and inclusive team. “We have an incredible record of human evolution in South Africa, but the entire narrative of palaeoanthropology has been dominated by white men, many of whom aren’t even South African,” Pickering said. One way Heri aimed to get more black women into the industry was through involving them in field research. Heri has field camps planned for the Women’s Day weekend in August, along the West Coast. They hoped about 20 women from all backgrounds would participate. For information on Heri’s fellowship opportunities visit bit.ly/2MJwXCk Cape Times
