Child Protection Week, observed this week, aims to raise awareness and mobilise communities to care for and protect children from abuse, neglect, exploitation and other forms of violence and ill-treatment. The Afrika Tikkun marketing co- ordinator, Nikita Mqhayi, said: “Child and youth development is one of the programmes offered at Afrika Tikkun, and young people attend daily sessions where they are given a platform to speak up about issues that bother them. “Issues of abuse such as bullying and peer pressure come up often. “Knowing what children go through and which issues to combat makes it easier for the children to get help from social workers and police officers. “The parade also aids in letting children speak up and be heard. “It aids in informing parents as well as the community that children also have rights and need to be protected. “People witness abuse happening within their communities, but don’t know how to go about reporting the issue to the right people. “This is where the Child Protection Parade comes in handy - it raises awareness that abuse is a big problem among young people and needs to be addressed.” Social workers were available for children enrolled with the organisation.
