The seven social activists are attempting to raise at least R500 000 for Fanang Diatlala Centre for the Disabled and Kusasa Lethu Trust. Arranged by Enabling Disability Education Nationally (Eden), the non-profit organisation had previously arranged a 600km walk from Tshwane to Durban in 2017, which had raised R170000. A large portion of the proceeds were donated to the Transoranje School for the Deaf in Tshwane and the Fanang Diatla Centre for the Disabled in Temba. On Monday, participants were walking from George to Swellendam. Eden co-founder Samuel Modise said: “The focus of the walk is to empower, and also create awareness on disability,” Modise said. Using the hashtag #Walk4YDE19, the group hoped to get their efforts trending. For more information or to make a donation, contact Modise at 081 705 8251, or email sammy75modise@gmail.com.
