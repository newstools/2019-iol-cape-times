Cape Town – The world yesterday commemorated International Women in Engineering Day under #TransformThe Future, which celebrated women thriving in what was traditionally a predominantly white male-driven field. The Association of South African Women in Science and Engineering (ASAWSE), a non-profit organisation, said there was still work to be done to get more women in field. ASAWSE provincial chairperson Taime Sylvester said: “This day is important as it highlights the importance of women in engineering. “Africa, including South Africa, has a critical shortage of trained technological women. “Increasing the number of technologically-trained women is essential for development. “Girls in Africa should be encouraged to take science subjects, not only those girls who might pursue a scientific or technological career, but also those who would then be enabled to apply scientific concepts in their daily lives.” ASAWSE said it aimed to overcome these challenges by highlighting and addressing problems faced specifically by women in these fields. “We need to provide role models for young people wishing to enter the fields of science and engineering. ‘‘Taking science subjects should not only be seen as a vocation but as a means to develop the scientific and technological culture necessary for development. ‘‘Women are the greatest resource any country has. Providing encouragement and opportunity for girls and women in science and engineering is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing this resource for the development of the country,” she said.
