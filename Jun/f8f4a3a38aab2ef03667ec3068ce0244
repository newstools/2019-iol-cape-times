While on their way to work, they arrested a would-be thief in Table View yesterday. The 22-year-old man was hiding behind a car. “On our approaching him the suspect started to run away and was pursued. He was caught with car breaking tools - an Allen key and cable ties. "He was arrested for attempted theft out of a motor vehicle and is expected to appear at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court once charged,” said police spokesperson George Mjiwu. Meanwhile, the vigilance of members attached to the Flying Squad landed three suspects behind bars for being in possession of the remains of a hijacked vehicle in Delft South yesterday. They were patrolling the Delft area when their attention was drawn to three men busy with a vehicle next to the R300. “Their investigation revealed that the Chevrolet Aveo was hijacked in Kuilsriver on Sunday. The three suspects, aged 31, 35 and 39, were arrested and what was left of the vehicle was confiscated. "Once charged, the three suspects are expected to make a court appearance in Blue Downs,” said police spokesperson Andre Traut. Cape Times
