It will be the third session hosted by the consulate this month, following the first which took place at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and the second at the Newlands Cricket Stadium. The consulate has made immense effort to spread the spiritual practice, to encourage people to adopt yoga as part of their lifestyle for its physical, mental and emotional benefits. Yoga is the ancient Indian practice of holistic well-being which encourages both a healthy body and mind. The event will also include yoga nidra - an ancient relaxation technique helpful for people seeking relief from long-standing symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and who suffer from emotional, psychological and deep-rooted muscular tensions. “It is a powerful stress relieving technique in which you can learn to relax consciously sometimes referred to as psychic sleep or inner awareness. “It is a threshold state between sleep and wakefulness, contact with the subconscious and unconscious dimensions occur spontaneously,” said Indian consul-general Abhishek Shukla. The event on Saturday runs from 9.30am to 12.30pm, with refreshments served. It will include short talks, demonstrations and meditation session. Participants are requested to bring their own mats.
