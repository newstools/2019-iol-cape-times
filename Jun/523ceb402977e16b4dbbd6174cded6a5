The vigil followed a service that marked the end of the start of their Eid-ul-Fitr festival celebrations. Demonstrators’ placards expressed solidarity with victims of attacks in Burkina Faso, Sri Lanka and Christchurch, and urged protection of synagogues, temples, churches and mosques. In a statement issued before the vigil, the mosque’s Imam Rashied Omar said they were aware there were several attacks on churches in West Africa in the context of a Muslim Jihadist insurgency in that region during Ramadan. “Our mosque decries the fact that these attacks did not receive much, if any, media coverage, nor any prominent condemnation from fellow religious institutions and leaders. “As we say farewell to the blessed month of Ramadan and mark the festival of Eid, we wish to pause in memory of the Christian believers killed in these terrible attacks, as well as extend our deepest sympathies to our fellow Christian brothers and sisters,” he said.
