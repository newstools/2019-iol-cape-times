Andrew Nhasri, 32, and Mike Masozha, 22, had terrorised Uber drivers during May and early June 2017 in Bellville. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the two had been arrested in Goodwood and charged for their involvement in four hijackings, with cases reported in Belhar, Delft, Mfuleni and Goodwood. “The Anti-Hijacking Unit’s investigation revealed the convicts would make requests in Bellville and, en route to their destinations, the so-called clients would pepper-spray the drivers, choke them and threaten them with guns. “The drivers were then robbed of their belongings and their vehicles.” Nhasri was sentenced to 50 years for three counts of aggravated robbery, while Masozha was given 34 years for the same crimes. The trend of criminals using e-hailing apps to hijack drivers has been on the rise, so much so that certain areas including Langa, Nyanga and Manenberg are red-flagged by drivers. The City has also called for a conversation with Uber and Bolt. Cape Times
