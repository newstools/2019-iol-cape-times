 Cape Town – The ANC in the Western Cape has been shocked by the death of Andiswa Ndevu, who died in a multiple car accident on Wednesday morning. She had been trying to escape a violent protest at the corner of Lansdowne and Symphony Way, an important intersection that links Crossroads, Delft and Luzuko. After a car in front of her had been stoned, she attempted to make a U-turn and another vehicle drove into her, said ANC Western Cape provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs. "Comrade Ndevu, a single parent and member of the ANC in Ward 42 Gugulethu, as well as of the ANC Women’s and Youth Leagues, was trying to escape violent protests at the corner of Lansdowne and Symphony Way, an important intersection that links Crossroads, Delft and Luzuko," Jacobs said. "According to our members, a car in front of her had been stoned and as she attempted to make a U-turn, another vehicle drove into her one. She died on the spot. “We are shocked and saddened by the death of our comrade. We express our condolences with her family and call on our communities to refrain from taking their frustrations and anger out on motorists. "There are other more peaceful ways to protest.” Two people were reportedly killed in the crash involving three vehicles. Cape Times
