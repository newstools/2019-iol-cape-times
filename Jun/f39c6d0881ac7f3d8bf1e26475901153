Durbanville - Western Cape police are investigating after a respected teacher was found murdered at her home in Durbanville on Monday. The 62-year-old educator from Hoërskool Monumentpark in Kraaifontein, Cape Town, was found by her son on Monday morning. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said that Helga van Wyk was killed during a robbery. Her husband Advocate Johann van Wyk was also injured during the robbery after he rushed to defend his wife. According to News24, he was stabbed multiple times by the assailant and was rushed to the  Durbanville Mediclinic. "Crime scene experts are still on the scene combing the area for clues," Van Wyk said. TEACHER KILLED IN PARKING LOT In April last year, another teacher, Cacelwa Mapila, was killed in Saldanha Bay. Mapila was shot and killed in front of her two children and pupils. The perpetrator is believed to have been her ex-husband. After the man killed Mapila, he ran off the school premises and killed himself. Police found his body with a gunshot wound to the head. A teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she saw Mapila running around her car trying to avoid shots fired by the man. But as much as she wanted to help, there was nothing she could do for Mapila. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said the pupils and Mapila’s two children who witnessed the incident had been traumatised and were receiving counselling.
