Cape Town - The SA Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a watch and warning for high seas inÂ the Western Cape and Eastern Cape on Wednesday. High seas with wave heights in excess of 6m are expected between Cape Columbine and Cape Agulhas, spreading eastwards to Plettenberg Bay by late Wednesday morning. The SAWS said that the weather also will be cloudy and cold, with morning rain and shower, expected in the north east where it will be partly cloudy. The wind along the coast will be moderate to fresh south-westerly but strong along the south coast. While in the Eastern Cape, high seas with wave heights in excess of 6m are expected in places along the south coast from late morning spreading to East London by the evening. The SAWS issued a warning to ships that they should "idle" into the swell and wind so that the bow of the ship always faces the oncoming swell, and additionally that only extremely surfers will tempt their fate in these weather conditions.
