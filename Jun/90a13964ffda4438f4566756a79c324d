This was the message from UN executive secretary for the Convention to Combat Desertification, Ibrahim Thiaw, on World Desertification Day. “There are only three things you need to know about the World Day to Combat Desertification: it isn’t just about sand, it isn’t an isolated issue that will quietly disappear, and it isn’t someone else’s problem,” Thiaw said. “It’s about restoring and protecting the fragile layer of land that only covers a third of the Earth, but which can either alleviate or accelerate the double-edged crisis facing our biodiversity and our climate. That makes it the problem of anyone who wants to eat, drink or breathe. “If we take action to restore our degraded land, it will save more than a billion dollars a day to invest in the education, equality and clean energy that can reduce poverty, conflict and environmental migration.” Thiaw said more and more people around the world were learning to understand the impact they had on the climate, and make choices to reduce it.
