The department’s safe schools directorate is busy beefing up security at 435 schools across the province that were identified as high-risk targets for burglary and vandalism. Jackson Bozo, from the task team, last week said criminals attempted to break into the kitchen of Mangaliso Primary, but were prevented by the burglar bars inside the window. Sosebenza Primary in Site B was identified as another school with a lot of burglary incidents. “We’re hoping these two primary schools won’t be forgotten this holiday because they’re at high risk. We’ll have a meeting as safety structures about our schools and see how we can also assist as residents, because security guards are not enough to deter criminals from ransacking our schools,” said Bozo. In March, the WCED recorded 160 burglary and vandalism incidents at schools in the province since the beginning of the year. WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said it was hoped having more guards would protect the schools and curb incidents. Cape Times
