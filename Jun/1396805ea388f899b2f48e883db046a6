The 49-year-old suspect, believed to be behind the murder of a Shoprite store manager, was arrested in Stellenbosch on Monday, said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. “An intelligence-driven operation by Stellenbosch and Worcester police led to the arrest of a suspect in connection with a murder and a business robbery perpetrated in Worcester yesterday morning,” said Rwexana. Three suspects accosted a 55-year-old woman after demanding keys from her. The woman refused and was shot in the head. “Police acted on information and traced a suspect who resides at Watergang Kayamandi in Stellenbosch. The suspect, who was not at home, arrived shortly afterwards and was arrested. A search was conducted and a 9mm firearm with ammunition were found, as well as an undisclosed amount of cash and a cellphone that was taken from one of the security guards during the robbery,” said Rwexana. The suspect is expected to appear in the Stellenbosch Magistrate’s Court on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and possession of stolen property. More charges may be added. “Police detectives are hot on the heels of the remaining suspects.” Anybody with information is asked to anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
