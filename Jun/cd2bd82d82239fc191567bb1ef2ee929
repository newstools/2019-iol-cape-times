In what has been described as a war zone, the areas are now being monitored closely by police. The shootings started in Blikkiesdorp late on Thursday night, with five people shot and killed when a group of men approached and opened fire at the victims, who were seated around an open fire. Less than 24 hours later, the police’s flying squad responded to gunshots in Primrose Street, Athlone, where they spotted two suspects firing shots. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said: “The suspects were pursued and arrested after they collided with a tree in Klipfontein Road. It was established that the vehicle had been hijacked and that two unknown men were shot and killed not far from where the suspects, aged 18 and 26, were arrested. “The circumstances are being investigated and the suspects are due to make a court appearance in Athlone (today).” That same night in KTC, Gugulethu, three young men were shot and killed, allegedly by rival gang members. Blikkiesdorp Joint Committee member Ettienne Claasen said vigilantes set the house of a suspected gangster alight yesterday and that residents were living in fear. Traut said police were investigating all the incidents. Anyone with information can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.. CAPE TIMES
