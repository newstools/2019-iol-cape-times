It’s also why little Snoopy was admitted to the Mdzananda Animal Clinic in Khayelitsha in the early hours of a blistering cold morning. Concerned owners had rushed the four-week-old puppy to the clinic as he was in a state of hypothermia. The tiny puppy was wet, seemingly left outside overnight in the cold and rain. Mdzananda’s veterinarian, Dr Joy, had rushed the tiny puppy to the clinic’s theatre and while rubbing his body to activate blood movement, she turned on a bair hugger - a warming device and temperature management system used during surgery to maintain a patient’s body temperature. Fund-raising and communications manager Marcelle du Plessis said hypothermic puppies generally do not survive. “After a couple of hours and a lot of TLC, Snoopy lifted his head. He was given soft, warm food, specifically formulated for recovering puppies and he drank some water. "This was a good sign,” Du Plessis said. But Snoopy’s journey isn’t over yet. Once Snoopy is ready he will return to his owners.
