Williams, 47, was arrested a year ago for the murder of 21-year-old Kuils River mother Chantell Matthysen. Following his arrest it emerged Williams faced rape and murder charges relating to other victims, including Natalie Jonkers, 38, whose skeletal remains were found just days after Matthysen’s body. Matthysen’s mother, Carol Petersen, said delays in Williams’ prosecution affected them emotionally and financially. “When we got here (yesterday) morning we expected his case to be heard close to midday, but when we arrived he had already appeared and we missed his appearance. “Yesterday we heard that the case might be moved to the high court soon, and we are very happy for that,” Petersen said. Matthysen went missing on June23 last year after she left her home in Sarepta, and travelled to Wellington to meet Williams, a family friend, for a job. A few days later the young mother’s body was found in a shallow grave near Aubon Rue Farm. Some of her clothing was found at Williams’s shack. After his arrest, Williams pointed out other sites to the police where at least three other bodies of victims were buried. This included Jonkers, who went missing in 2012. CAPE TIMES
