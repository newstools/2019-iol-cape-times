Cape Town – The NSRI is continuing its search for a fisherman along the False Bay coast after a boat capsized around noon yesterday. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said on Friday morning that the hunt is "ongoing" after an extensive search was activated just after 4pm yesterday. One man drowned and another was transported to hospital in a critical condition with severe hypothermia. He has been stabilised and is recovering in hospital, the NSRI said. The fishermen had launched their boat on Thursday morning from Kalk Bay. "During an extensive air, sea and shoreline search, two of the missing men were located clinging onto a life-ring. They were recovered onto a sea rescue craft," the NSRI said. "Despite the extensive search no sign of the third man has been found. A Police Dive Unit has been tasked to continue with an ongoing search operation. "The SA Navy ship SAS Protea joined the search and are assisting NSRI Simon’s Town and NSRI Kommetjie, together with Fire and Rescue services divers to recover the capsized boat." The NSRI said the circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown at this stage.
