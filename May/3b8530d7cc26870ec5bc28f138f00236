Cape Town – The teenager arrested in connection with the murder of Bonnievale vintner Tool Wessels made a brief appearance in the Bonnievale Circuit Court on Thursday and was remanded. The 19-year-old Ntabanyane Tlale faces a preliminary charge of murder. Further charges are expected to be laid at his next court appearance next week Thursday, Netwerk24 reported. One of the firearms stolen during the incident, a .22 rifle, was seized by police. Lesotho citizen Tlale is accused that he and three other suspects – also believed to be Lesotho citizens – attacked Tool, 55, and his wife Liezel, 51, on Monday night. Tool and his wife, who were about to leave for choir practice and a support group meeting, were allegedly tortured before he was shot dead at their Kapteinsdrift farm outside Bonnievale. Liezel was stabbed and had boiling water repeatedly poured on her but managed to escape and call for help at a nearby farm. "Bonnievale is such a nice town," Dutch Reformed Church cleric Willem Liebenberg told News24 after Tool was found murdered. "There is heartache over what happened, but we will carry on," he said. He said the Wessels' daughters, Annelie and Jana, who are studying at Stellenbosch University, are spending most of their time at their mother's bedside in Worcester. "She is stable. I think her body is very broken and sore, but by grace, she is stable," he said.
