Cape Town – Four people died after a gas leak at a plastic recycling plant in the Beaconvale industrial zone, near Parow, on Tuesday afternoon, while two men had to be taken to hospital, City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said. "At 2.20pm this afternoon, the City's Fire and Rescue Service responded to persons (sic) bodies trapped in Birch Street, Beaconvale," said Carelse.

Subsequently, the four bodies were recovered. A further three males were treated on the scene and two were taken to hospital."
