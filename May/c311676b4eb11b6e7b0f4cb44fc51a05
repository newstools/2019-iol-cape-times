Cape Town â€“ Four people were killed in two separate car crashes in the Western Cape on Friday where the drivers lost control of their vehicles. The driver of a light motor vehicle died in a collision with a truck on the road between Roberson and Worcester, while three women were killed after the driver of a Toyota Avanza lost control of the vehicle between Laignsburg and Leeu-Gamka on the N1. Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa said the three women were flung from the car on impact on Friday morning. Commenting on the collision between Roberson and Worcester, he said a female motorist apparently lost control of her vehicle near the Rooiberg wine cellar and crashed sideways into a truck. Malcolm Wadeley posted on Facebook: "I travel that road a lot going to George. How on earth do accidents happen like that. My heart goes out to the families of the deceased. I get rattled by this. Is it speed, not observing the road, talking on cellphone. Sorry to all." Zandile-iintombi ZamaMaya Nkita posted: "Seemingly there are a lot of accidents happening on this road. Haibo." Cape Times
