“It is this dependence that has allowed the utility to throw massive amounts of money that it categorically does not have into a bottomless pit to try to complete Kusile. “If Eskom is shocked by its latest R36bn bill, Greenpeace is equally shocked that the utility is pushing ahead with a dead-end project, which has been poorly executed and cannot easily be turned around. “The truth is that Eskom is in real trouble, and so are Medupi and Kusile. “South Africans are sick and tired of our dysfunctional electricity supply industry, and trying to complete Kusile simply does not make sense, any way you look at it. "Eskom needs to cancel Kusile and shift investments into renewable energy to avoid a death spiral that it cannot escape.” Chris Vlavianos Greenpeace Africa Communications officer
