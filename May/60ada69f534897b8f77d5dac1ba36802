Cape Town â€“ The 38-year-old man charged with attempted murder after he allegedly drove over a security guard with his bakkie appeared in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court on Friday. Johan Steyn, of Kraaifontein, handed himself over to police after a video of the alleged hit-and-run incident in the parking area of a Stellenbosch shopping complex went viral. In the video, the security guard seemingly tried to prevent Steyn from exiting the parking lot by driving up a one-way. The guard's gesticulating was in vain as he can be seen lying on the ground in the video after Steyn allegedly drove over him. Steyn has been released on bail of R2 000, the SABC reported. The case has been postponed to June 27 for further investigation. The security guard was treated at a local hospital and has since been discharged. Magistrate Alaric Amos granted him bail after defence lawyer Bruce Hendricks argued that he was not a flight risk and would abide by all bail conditions, News24 reported. Steyn, who owns a general building repairs and maintenance business, argued in an affidavit that he should be released from custody because he had to look after his wife and their one-year-old son.
