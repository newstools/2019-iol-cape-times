Ezra was shot and killed in 2017, while he was playing outside and got caught in gang crossfire. A bullet had penetrated his neck, and he was declared dead on the scene. Bianchi, 33, had entered into a plea agreement with the State and was sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment on seven charges, including murder. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The provincial police commissioner of the Western Cape, Khombinkosi Jula, commended a detective attached to Provincial Organised Crimes who worked tirelessly to ensure that an alleged gang leader was convicted for the crimes he committed in 2017.” Ezra’s aunt Beryl said: “We are overjoyed that he has been sentenced. This is what we have been waiting for.” Bianchi was found guilty of murder, two counts under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, two charges of attempted murder, possession of ammunition without a firearm license and the possession of an unlicensed firearm. His sentences will run concurrently, so he will effectively serve 25 years behind bars. CAPE TIMES
