ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at 6.55am after the man had run to a nearby residence after the incident. “The man was found seated inside. Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained a gunshot wound to his lower back." The man was treated for his injuries and taken to hospital for further treatment. The Hout Bay Community Policing Forum (CPF) said: “Two instances of armed robbery have been reported this morning, with a jogger shot in the lower back during one. The victim was miraculously not seriously injured. The spate of robberies has been raised to the highest levels of the SAPS over the past few weeks, with the CPF engaging senior provisional command and the minister to immediately provide resources to assist the local station to deal with the criminals. "We will continue to fight for resources to deal with the spike in robberies and the general lack of SAPS members at Hout Bay station. "Residents must be on the alert when walking, jogging or cycling. Incidents have been reported in Hughenden, Harbour Heights and now in Beach Estate.” Anyone with information about the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
