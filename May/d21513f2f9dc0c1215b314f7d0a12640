This is what the provincial Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport, through its museum service, is asking Capetonians for their contribution towards the conceptualisation of the Cape Town Museum. Spokesperson Tania Colyn said the department, through its museum service, had appointed Place Matters to conduct the research and conceptualisation process for the Cape Town Museum. “As part of this process, Place Matters will be conducting workshops and engagements with members of the public to get their input on what they think the Cape Town Museum should be,” Colyn said. Cape Town means many different things to many different people, and has been shaped by the many people who have lived in or visited Cape Town. The department has appealed to the public to share their stories of Cape Town and what Cape Town means to them, to inform what stories need to be told and how. The project aims to create a modern museum that might break away from the conventional look and feel of traditional museums. “However, the museum should reflect what you consider to be ‘your Cape Town’ and, therefore, has embarked on this process to get as much input as possible into the museum concept,” Colyn said. The department has encouraged all interested members of the public to go to the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/whatsyourcapetown/ or Twitter account https://twitter.com/whatsyourcapet1 to be informed of all the planned engagements.
