The Concert in the Park will be hosted by the Thelma Susan Block Dumas Institute (TSBD) and feature established and new local artists. The annual event aims to highlight the institute’s work, offering solutions to youth unemployment. Founder Keith Dumas said the concert introduced talent from under-resourced areas to the public and created an opportunity for people to learn more about TSBD. “We’re inviting old and young to come and get to know what the organisation is about and enjoy amazing performances free. "There will be performances from the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra and the Cape Cultural Collective’s Rosa Choir, as well as other local artists,” Dumas said. He said the institution assisted unemployed youth through advanced skills programmes, leadership development and help with university applications. TSBD was formed in 2014, and has helped more than 250 unemployed youth. Dumas said the organisation was planning to extend its programme to rural areas. “This year alone we have 105 students from townships such as Gugulethu, Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and Hanover Park. “We help our students with NSFAS applications and online applications to tertiary institutions, and offer computer programmes like coding,” said Dumas.
