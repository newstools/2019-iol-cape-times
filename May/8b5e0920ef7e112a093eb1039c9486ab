State prosecutor Nathan Adriaanse said certain names on the petition, allegedly signed by residents of Kleinvlei, Melton Rose and Eerste River, “were repeated and was a lie”. Adriaanse asked the court to dismiss the petition and also to dismiss another petition by residents to the State, calling for Volkwyn to remain in custody. Volkwyn, 40, is accused of murdering 20-month-old Orderick Lucas after kidnapping him. He faces an additional charge of defeating the administration of justice. He appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court yesterday. According to the State, a post-mortem conducted on Orderick’s body could not conclude if the child died due to natural or unnatural causes due to the “state of decomposition”. It, however, found that strangulation “could be a possibility, but must be approached with caution” due to bruises to Orderick’s “right neck muscle”. Volkwyn will hear the outcome of his application for bail on June 12. CAPE TIMES
