Cape Town – A woman died after her Bonteheuwel home caught fire in the early hours on Monday morning. City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said firefighters responded to the blaze just after 1am on Monday in Bonteheuwel Avenue. The cause of the fire is being investigated. “Three fire-fighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 14 staff members were in attendance. Upon arrival it was confirmed that one person was still inside the dwelling," Carelse said. "Fire-fighting as well as search and rescue operations ensued simultaneously. The fire was extinguished at 02:45am. "One adult female sustained fatal burn wounds. The cause of the fire is unknown.” After five families were left homeless after a fire ripped through their homes in Bonteheuwel last November, ward councillor Angus Mckenzie said: “As a community and as people we need to take care and be vigilant around fire security. "We need to ensure that plugs are done properly and we don’t have illegal (electricity) connections, especially at this time of year.” Cape Times
