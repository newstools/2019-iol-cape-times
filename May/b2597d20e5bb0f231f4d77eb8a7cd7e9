Cape Town – Metro police arrested a drunk driver with an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in the boot of his silver VW Polo early on Saturday morning. Metro police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said officials on patrol in Steve Biko Drive in Gugulethu stopped the 40-year-old man and asked to see his driving licence. When he opened the boot of his car, police found a 9mm pistol and live rounds of ammunition. According to Solomons, the motorist was arrested when the firearm licence did not match his ID number. He told officers the firearm belonged to his father. A breathalyser test also confirmed the man was three times over the legal alcohol limit. Western Cape Traffic boss Kenny Africa said 14 drunk drivers have been arrested in the province since yesterday. The highest reading recorded was three times over the legal limit in George and Gugulethu. A driver was also arrested for possessing false documentation in George and another for the possession of mandrax in Vredenburg. In total, said Africa, 133 fines to the value of more than R170 000 were issued. He said 313 speedsters was also caught.
