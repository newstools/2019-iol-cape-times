Cape Town – The sexual assault and crimen injuria case against former ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman has been postponed to July 10 in the Kimberley Magistrate's Court. Fransman appeared briefly in court on charges of allegedly sexually assaulting his former personal assistant, Louisa Wynand, in January 2016 while on their way to the ANC's 104th birthday celebrations in Rustenburg, North West, the SABC reported. Fransman was suspended from the ANC for five years but has denied the allegations. At the end of February, Wynand expressed concern that the case against Fransman was taking too long. She has accused Fransman of touching her inappropriately. Her spokesperson, Gavin Prins, told EWN: "She’s worried about the fact that the case is taking so long. She was informed in December of 2018 that the case was going ahead and she was pleased. "Now we’re entering the third month of 2019 and she hasn’t heard anything."
