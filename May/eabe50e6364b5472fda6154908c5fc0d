Cape Town - The DA in Knysna was dealt a blow when its motion of no confidence in mayor Mark Willemse was defeated yesterday. In another setback, council speaker and DA councillor Georlene Wolmarans was removed following an ANC-sponsored motion of no confidence. She was replaced by ANC Councillor, Mertle Gombo as speaker of the Knysna council. The motion against Willemse was led by Michelle Wasserman, the would-be DA mayor-elect. Willemse said the victory was a “hollow one and not one he savoured”. Willemse had defied the DA leadership by refusing to step down after he and fellow DA councillor Peter Myers voted in favour of a motion against former mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies. The seven DA caucus members said: “We anticipate that councillors Willemse and Myers will join hands with the party that voted them into power and this will mean that Knysna Municipality may soon be governed by the ANC. But the truth of the matter, if you look at the facts, is that Knysna Municipality has not been governed by the DA since June 2018.” Wolmarans’ ousting comes after a motion was submitted by the ANC to remove her succeeded with 11 votes against eight. DA provincial leader Bonginkozi Madikizela said: “Following the failed motion of no confidence in mayor Mark Willemse, the DA has been left with no option other than to assume an opposition role.” CAPE TIMES
