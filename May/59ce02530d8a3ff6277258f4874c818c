In its 22nd year, the campaign will be observed under the theme “Let us Protect All Children to Move South Africa Forward”. The Department of Social Development said yesterday that this year's campaign, from June 2 to 9, would reflect on the strides made in observing, protecting and promoting the rights of the child. “Over the years, the CPW campaign has helped to ensure that the government and all key sectors of South African society work together to ensure the protection and promotion of the rights of children. "Despite the impressive progress that the government has made, significant challenges still remain. "Key areas of concern include child trafficking for child labour and sexual exploitation, children in conflict with the law, children living and working in the streets, child poverty and access to educational opportunities for children with disabilities, undocumented and unaccompanied children, among others.” Cape Times
