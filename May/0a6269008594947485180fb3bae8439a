Cape Town â€“ A 65-year-old man who was charged with murder after he had tried to protect himself and his family against an armed housebreaker is a free man. The case against Giel Fourie, from Grabouw, was withdrawn in the local magistrate's court on Monday, Netwerk24 reported. Fourie was attacked with a knife in broad daylight after the intruder had walked into his house. Having warded off the attacker, he ran to his safe to fetch his firearm. He had first fired a warning shot and then ended up shooting the housebreaker twice in the chest. His wife, Susan, 62, and their 11-year-old grandchild was also in the house during the attack. Fourie was later arrested at the scene and let out on R500 bail. "This has been a rough start to the year for me," Fourie told Huisgenoot. "I am highly relieved it's all over. We expected that the case would be withdrawn because it's was a straightforward case of self-defence." However, while Fourie and his wife had put the nightmare experience behind them, his granddaughter is struggling to deal with what happened. Cape Times
