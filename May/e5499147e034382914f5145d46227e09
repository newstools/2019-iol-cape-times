Cape Town – The body of a man believed to be in his thirties has been found along the Strand coastline. Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said on Friday that an autopsy is being done to determine the cause of death. It's suspected that the man probably drowned as his body was covered in sand. "The man's identity hasn't been revealed yet," Traut said. According to sources close to the investigation, the man was well known in the area and could regularly be seen guarding cars, Netwerk24 reported. The source said a lot of people in the area were upset about the incident. Last October, the body of a man was found on Strand beach, presumed to be that of a missing person who disappeared in the surf in the same vicinity after falling out of a fishing vessel the day before. The body had washed out on the rocks and was found by a passer-by.
