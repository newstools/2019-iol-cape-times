Cape Town – An 18-year-old man will appear in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court on June 13 after he was filmed allegedly masturbating at Virgin Active in Stellenbosch by a fellow gym-goer. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a sexual assault case was opened on May 20 – four days after the incident – and the man was arrested on Thursday. He was not placed in custody and has only received a notice to appear in court. The gym promptly banned him for life and said it was going to pursue criminal charges after the video was posted on WhatsApp and social media. In the clip, the man, dressed in red gym gear, is seen staring at his cellphone on an exercise mat. His other hand is down his shorts. A white towel is draped over a part of his waist and he continues to make what appears to be tugging movements while a woman and a man exercise in close proximity. Cape Times
