Cape Town – Police have confirmed that they are investigating a case of attempted murder after a security guard was brazenly run over in a hit-and-run incident at a shopping centre in Stellenbosch. A video of the alleged incident, which according to a Twitter user took place at Die Boord, has gone viral on social media. A security guard can be seen indicating to the driver of a white bakkie not to head in the wrong direction. After losing patience with the security guard, the motorist ends up driving over him, with a bystander trying to prevent the vehicle from speeding off. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said on Tuesday the incident happened at the shopping complex between 2.30pm and 3pm last Tuesday. "According to reports, the complainant, who is a security officer, was on duty in the parking area and directed traffic. He directed the vehicle that was driving in the wrong direction to turn around. "The driver bumped him to the ground and drove over him. He was taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment." The guard's condition is unclear. No arrests have been made. Cape Times
