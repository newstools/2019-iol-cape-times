Cape Town â€“ Two rock climbers were injured on Thursday morning when a falling rock hit one of them on the back and leg at Llandudno while doing abseiling training with a group. A 60-year-old man injured his ankle while a 77-year-old man hurt his back and ankle and had to be transported to the Life Vincent-Pallotti Hospital in Pinelands via helicopter. A 60-year-old man was able to depart the scene in his own vehicle. Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johan Marais said they were alerted to the emergency at Llandudno at about 10.30am. A ground support team headed to the Suikerbossie restaurant in Hout Bay and a Skymed helicopter contracted to the Western Cape Health Department collected a paramedic in Pinelands before joining them. The climbers were rescued at noon, said Marais, and one of them left the scene by private transport while the other was taken to hospital. "As per our rules we cannot identify the patient," he said. "We hope that he will soon be able to enjoy the outdoor environment."
