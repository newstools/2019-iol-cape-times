The specialised linguistic zone’s launch on May 28, from 9am to 11.30am, at the school’s Wendy Condie Quad in Aliwal Road, Wynberg, highlights the school’s aim to encourage a passion for reading for leisure and for acquiring knowledge and language skills. The linguistic zone forms part of the move to align South Africa’s education goals to that of the global education community that focuses on building language skills in its vision for 2050. At the launch, the school’s principal, Shirley Harding, and school governing body chairperson Nicki Stock will explain how the new facilities are geared towards changing the way the school will shape the minds of young people for the future. With the current poor literacy levels and crippling unemployment rates, there is a desperate need in the country’s schools to enhance the way literacy skills are taught in and outside of the classroom, the school said. Wynberg Girls' High School is one of the oldest all-girls schools in South Africa. The first headmistress, Margaret Stewart, was supported by two teachers and catered to 27 pupils.
