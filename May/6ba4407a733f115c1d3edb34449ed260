In July last year, South Africa became the first country to roll out bedaquiline in its national programme. Bedaquiline improves the survival of patients with multidrug-resistant TB, potentially offering a shorter treatment with fewer side effects. The SU scientists said they would use their findings to influence tuberculosis treatment guidelines, to ensure that the right combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs were used along with bedaquiline in order to optimise patient treatment outcomes, while minimising the risk of developing resistance to the drug. “We need to protect bedaquiline from the development of resistance and therefore it is crucial to understand how quickly and through which mechanisms bedaquiline resistance develops,” said Dr Marg-aretha de Vos, one of the lead authors of a scientific commentary article recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. SU researchers studied the development of bedaquiline resistance in TB bacteria in a 65-year-old patient from Cape Town using a combination of novel techniques. These included one whole-genome sequencing of the bacteria in patient samples taken throughout various stages of the disease. Cape Times
