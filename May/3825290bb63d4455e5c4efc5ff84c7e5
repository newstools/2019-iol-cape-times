Cape Town – Police are investigating the circumstances that led to Stellenbosch University student Taylië Chamondre Jaap falling about 7m from the second floor of her campus residence window. The first-year BSc student was admitted to Stellenbosch hospital with serious injuries and later transferred to Tygerberg hospital after the incident in the early hours of Sunday morning at the Serruria residence. Western Cape police spokesperson Andre Traut said on Wednesday a case has been opened and that Stellenbosch police are investigating the circumstances in which she sustained the injuries. University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said the institution is supporting the police in their investigation. A source told Netwerk24 the 19-year-old Jaap has bleeding on the brain, skull fractures, a broken right arm and tender lower back vertebrae. "Her condition can be described as critical," university spokesperson Martin Viljoen said earlier in the week. "The university is in ongoing contact with the family via the staff of the centre for student communities, while the crisis service of the centre for student counselling and development has also offered counselling to Jaap's friends in the residence," Viljoen said. "The university calls on the campus community to respect the privacy of Ms Jaap and her family and to refrain from speculating on social media."
