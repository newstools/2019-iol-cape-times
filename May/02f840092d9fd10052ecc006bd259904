Cape Town â€“ The assault case involving a former Grade 9 Sans Souci Girls' High pupil was postponed until May 9 in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Afrikaans teacher Clarissa Venter, who returned to the school at the start of last month after her suspension, and the pupil's mother had laid counter-charges over their physical altercation in February, which was recorded in a video that went viral. Netwerk24 reported that Kailash Patel, the pupil's legal representative, said the reason for the postponement was that the pupil's docket wasn't at court. Venter must appear in court again on June 14 over her assault case. The pupil left the school before her hearing took place, while the school governing body gave Venter, who could be seen slapping the pupil in a video that went viral after she had been shoved, a final warning, fined her and ordered her to attend counselling sessions. The pupil's mother said outside court that under the circumstances it's going well with the pupil, who is attending a school closer to home. "She is moving on. She is enjoying the school. It's a different environment and something that needs adapting to, but she knows she must adapt and get on with things."
