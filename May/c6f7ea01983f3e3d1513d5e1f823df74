Cape Town – Locally based organisation Giving is Living is aiming to change the lives of township pets with its Movement for Mutts initiative, by replacing chains with warm kennels. Together with the Purple Kennel Project, the initiative aims to provide 100 kennels made from second-hand materials. Giving is Living co-founder Shankar Puri: “The number of dogs we will be unchaining depends entirely upon the support we receive from the public whether in the form of monetary donations, building materials and or volunteers. “The possibilities are endless and we cannot say how many we can unchain but the kennels and the unchaining project will be ongoing, it is not a short-term project but something we will be continuing long-term. “We are also having the sale to raise money for the initiative.” Material needed includes steel poles, cement, wire, hooks, durable strong collars, chains, anchors, bamboo fencing, chicken wire, and pallets. The foundation recently hosted an art auction in aid of three animal welfares: the Mdzananda Animal Clinic, Sanccob, and the Wolwerivier Outreach Work. It raised over R200 000 for the organisations.
