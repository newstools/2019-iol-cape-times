Cape Town – Metro police officers came under attack from a riotous crowd in Hanover Park on Thursday while arresting a teenager for the possession of an unlicensed firearm. Officers were conducting crime prevention patrols just after 11am when they heard shorts in the vicinity of Oribi Court, the City said. They responded and spotted a suspect running away, firearm in hand. "When officers approached him, he pointed the firearm at them, but was soon disarmed after officers discharged a warning shot. "While placing the 16-year-old under arrest for possession of an unlicensed firearm, a crowd of about 200 bystanders attacked the officers with stones, to prevent the arrest." "Officers were able to leave the area, with the suspect, and he was detained at Philippi SAPS." A few hours earlier, just after 7am, the same officers had arrested an 18-year-old suspect for the illegal possession of an imitation firearm in Silica Walk in the area. Officers were responding to complaints of an armed robbery in the area when they spotted the suspect dressed in a hoodie and a scarf covering his face – as described by complainants, the City said. The suspect was apprehended and found in possession of the imitation firearm. He was also detained at the Philippi police station. Cape Times
