Last year, faced with an application for development from the Liesbeek Leisure Properties Trust, owners of the River Club in Observatory, HWC resolved to provisionally protect the property from development. Activists say this is the site of a 100-year-old floodplain where three rivers converge, and apart from accommodating seasonal migrating birds and indigenous flora and fauna, it is also the cremation ground of the early Quena (Otentottu) people. The ANC in the province said Dlamuka on Friday surprisingly recommended to a special council meeting of HWC to withdraw this protection. Interested parties and civic organisations harshly criticised the recommendation, and the ANC, through Khoi and San leaders Prince Titus, Captain Witbooi and Chief Melvyn Arendse, represented by Winston Erasmus, persuaded the special council meeting to reject the recommendations. Two Rivers Urban Park Association chair Tauriq Jenkins said Dlamukaâ€™s recommendation felt like a demolition of the consultative process. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs lauded the decision for the provisional protection of the land in question. CAPE TIMES
