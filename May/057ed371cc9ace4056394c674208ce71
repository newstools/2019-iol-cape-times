Police have welcomed a 12-year jail/prison sentence handed to a self-confessed cable thief. The man’s sentence follows that of another cable thief, who last month received a 10-year jail sentence that was suspended for four years. And while 27 other suspects remain in custody until their court appearances. The Rail Enforcement Unit had over the past week inspected 66 hot spot areas and scrapyards, while the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) teams had attended to the 27 court cases in various magistrate courts. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the conviction bode well in the fight against cable theft. “We are pleased with the conviction, whoever is involved in the theft. “And we warn other perpetrators to refrain from committing crimes because this affects whole communities and the business sector. “We welcome the conviction,” Rwexana said. A joint report by Metrorail, the City and the province showed six operations and 28 stop-and-searches were conducted while 66 hot spot areas and scrapyards were inspected. A suspect was arrested in Diep River for the possession of suspected stolen property, and he was issued a R2 000 fine. “The majority of suspects pleaded guilty as a result of the solid evidence provided by Prasa investigators,” Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said. “All arrests and convictions contribute to improved predictability of the train service, and the reduction of crime on trains and at stations,” Walker said.
