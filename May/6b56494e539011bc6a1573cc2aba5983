Now in its fourth year, the City’s annual #YouthStartCT entrepreneurial challenge is designed for local entrepreneurs, aged between 18 and 35, who will undergo a series of training sessions to help develop their ideas. The City yesterday said it had received applications from 89 businesses representing 216 young people. After the shortlisting process, 99 contestants were left standing, representing 52 businesses, and all of the competitors are aged between 23 and 35. Of the total businesses that have entered the challenge, just over a quarter were female-led, the City said. Through the knockout rounds, the group will be whittled down to Top 50, Top 25, Top 10 and eventually Top 3. Mayco member for community services Zahid Badroodien said: “We have secured amazing prizes for the competition this year, but the participants will also have access to mentoring and training opportunities long after the curtain has fallen on the competition.” Cape Times
