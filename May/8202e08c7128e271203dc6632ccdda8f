Cape Town â€“ Two men appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday over a burglary at the Kensington Community Day Centre. Bail was opposed for the 33- and 45-year-old, said police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. During their arrests police officers had confiscated, among other things, computer equipment, a heart machine, boxes of scissors and memory sticks. A Renault Transporter, allegedly used during the crimes, was also seized. "All electronic and medical equipment including non-medical items were stolen or damaged, and therefore services cannot operate optimally," Western Cape government health spokesperson Monique Johnstone told News24. "We are deeply distressed by the lack of respect shown towards health care and we applaud the police for their quick response in finding the perpetrators and retrieving a few of the stolen items." The total theft and damages incurred amounted to around R800 000, authorities said. Four other suspects were identified and will be arrested after evidence linking them to the alleged crimes was collected. Johnstone said only the chronic dispensing unit was operational for patients to collect their pre-packed medication.
