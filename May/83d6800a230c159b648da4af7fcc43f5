Schooling was disrupted last week in several Kraaifontein schools, including Masibambane Secondary and Wallacedene Secondary when thousands of disgruntled parents and pupils took to the streets in solidarity with Bloekombos Secondary School, which was closed for two days. The protesters demanded that a new school be built in the area, however the department refused, saying a new high school was built earlier this year to alleviate other schools in the area, but it was not being utilised. On hearing this, protesters went on a rampage and allegedly set fire to two houses and threw litter inside other schools. Bloekombos Secondary is only able to accommodate 1200 pupils, but 2116 were enrolled. An SGB member who did not want to be named for fear of victimisation said: “The school will remain closed if the department doesn't send its people to engage with us here in Bloekombos; we will not go to them. "The Grade 12s are starting exams soon and they are writing their tests in corridors outside, as the hall doesn't fit all of them, what if it rains? Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said: “The department has alternative plans that could alleviate the situation. "The department is currently extracting information regarding pupils at the school." Okuhle Hlati
