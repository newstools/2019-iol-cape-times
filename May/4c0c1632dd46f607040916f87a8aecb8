Zietsman appeared in the Bredasdorp Magistrate’s Court yesterday and his case has been postponed to June 4 for an identity parade, as well as for DNA test results to come back, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila. Zietsman, 35, was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of 6-year-old Delvina Europa, after the girl went missing on March24. Delvina’s body was found two days later, in bush, in the quiet Moravian mission station town of Elim. Last month Zietsman, who was known by Delvina’s family, abandoned his bail application for unknown reasons in the Bredasdorp Magistrate’s Court. He had previously been convicted of sexual assault. In the wake of Delvina’s murder, the Elim community united in prayer. Residents said it would be best for Zietsman to remain in custody as “the safety of the accused cannot be guaranteed”. Cape Times
