His alleged murderer, Melvin Volkwyn, is expected to appear for his bail application in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. Mourners gathered at the Teen Challenge Centre in Kleinvlei, Eersteriver, on Saturday to say their final farewell to Orderick, who was buried in a tiny white coffin. Orderick’s mother, Davidene Lucas, cried inconsolably throughout the funeral service. Last week Davidene saw her son’s body for the first time since he went missing on March 24. His naked body was found in a stormwater drain in Wittebol Street, Kleinvlei, eight days later. Grandmother Cornelia Scheepers said the family was still dealing with the trauma and Davidene was “going through a very rough time”. Davidene’s remaining children, twins who are in the care of social workers, were brought to the funeral with a foster carer to say their last goodbyes to their brother. Forensic Pathology Services spokesperson Mark van der Heever said an autopsy was conducted on Orderick’s body on April 3, a day after he was found. CAPE TIMES
