World Trauma Day highlighted the impact of violent crimes, including at provincial health sites. Department spokesperson Byron la Hoe said during the first quarter of the financial year - between April 1 and June 3 - 634 security incidents were reported. A staggering 382 incidents of threatening behaviour towards staff was included in this total, while there were 60 incidents of theft/burglary; 54 incidents of damage to property; and 52 incidents of physical assault. There were 16 assaults on emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. “Health workers often bear the brunt of traumatic stress, which severely impacts their personal functioning, interpersonal relationships and employment. “Such stress is associated with a variety of other psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and somatisation,” said La Hoe. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said police still escorted EMS staff to various sites due to violent attacks. “The SAPS will continue to support EMS personnel and ensure their safety when they attend to call-outs,” said Rwexana.
