After load shedding was terminated at 11pm on Saturday night, Eskom said no load shedding was planned for October 20. The power utility, however, added that "the system remain constrained and volatile and load shedding could be implemented at short notice should there be a significant shift in plant performance and increased unplanned technical breakdowns." While some units returned to service as planned, emergency diesel and water reserves had to be used on Saturday to supplement capacity, as generating units returned to service later than expected. Eskom hoped to replenish diesel reserves for its open cycle gas turbines and to increase water levels at its pumped storage schemes so as to avoid and minimise load shedding in the coming week. "Plans are progressing well to repair the conveyor belt at Medupi power station to achieve full operation, and to expedite the return of units that experienced technical problems. As we are experiencing a heat wave in some parts of the country, we ask customers to use air conditioners efficiently at 23ÂºC," Eskom said in a statement.
