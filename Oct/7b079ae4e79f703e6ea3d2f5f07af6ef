The annual competition draws young musicians from all over the country who compete in four gruelling rounds, with only six finalists selected to perform a concerto with the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra. Brooks, from Fairways, is a Grade 10 pupil at Westerford High School and fell in love with the sound of the violin at the age of 3. He has been a student of Anne-Marié Swanepoel at Beau Soleil Music Centre in Kenilworth since he was 7. Within the first couple of months of tuition his teacher recognised his exceptional natural talent. “Jordan is currently the concert master of the Cape Town Philharmonic Youth Orchestra as well as the Beau Soleil Senior String Ensemble,” the Beau Soleil Music Centre said. “In 2015 he was overall winner of the Samro-Hubert van der Spuy Music Competition for primary school learners. ‘‘Jordan has performed as soloist with orchestras and ensembles and is a keen chamber musician who takes part every year in the Franschhoek Chamber Music Workshop as well as the Stellenbosch International Chamber Music Festival. ‘‘In 2018 he joined the Miagi Youth Orchestra as first violinist on their extended tour to Europe.” Cape Times
