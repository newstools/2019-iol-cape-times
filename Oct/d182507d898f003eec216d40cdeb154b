Nellis Beyers, the neighbourhood watch chairperson for District Six, said: “The area of Zonnebloem is not getting the service delivery that it deserves. Residents have to complain and log numerous service requests before they see action, if any. Together, our voices carry more weight and we want to see change in our neighbourhood.” The online petition had been started to call for improved services in Zonnebloem and to help residents prevent illegal squatting and curb crime. “Basic services, like the maintenance of street lights and stormwater lids, are critical for the area. The upgrading of street lights, especially around the ‘Stroompie’ area, will help to make the area more secure,” Beyers said. “The closing off and securing of stormwater drains is needed because vagrants open them for water or to live in the sewers, creating a hazard for themselves as well as for others, especially children, who could fall into these holes. The closing off of stormwater drains in the area would also make it less attractive to squat or invade land in Zonnebloem.” Residents had addressed the petition to councillor Brandon Golding, who had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Beyers said illegal squatting and the invasion of land created many problems in the area. “Squatters litter and often get violent and abusive. There is alcohol- and drug-abuse that goes hand in hand with noise disturbance. Cooking fires reek of burnt plastic and often veld fires are caused. The City's resources get wasted on the fire brigade having to be called out.” He called on more residents to sign the petition. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
