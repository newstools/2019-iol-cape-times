The town was brought to a standstill at the weekend when residents protested housing allocations at a new development. Residents said they were not consulted as to who the occupants were, after six beneficiaries they expected were to move in, were rejected for not meeting requirements. The Noordhoek Steering Committee said it asked the municipality to engage them on allocations. Bergrivier municipality mayor Ray van Rooy has since met with residents. Community leader Jean Jephtas yesterday said the meeting was interrupted when an object was thrown through the window. “There were hundreds of people at the hall who all wanted the mayor and his officials to answer them about the housing allocations. “Someone threw a brick through a window and the police escorted the mayor and officials,” he said. Committee chairperson Lindsay Loubscher said the dispute could have been avoided had the municipality included the committee in the process to replace the beneficiaries. Bergrivier municipality municipal manager Hanlie Linde said a delegation consisting of ward councillors, municipal officials, and the mayor attended the meeting. “We are taking the issues raised by the steering committee into account, but we must allocate houses in accordance with the national housing policy,” she said. Linde said the situation in Velddrif was currently under control. Cape Times
