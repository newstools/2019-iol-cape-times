Another person was wounded in the shooting and is in a critical condition, police spokesperson Siyabulela Malo said. Malo said murder and attempted murder cases were opened after an incident on Monday in Mars Street, Somerset Heights in Kleinvlei, at 8.20pm. “Police found five victims,” said Malo. Three people were declared dead and two were taken to hospital. A fourth died in hospital yesterday. They were aged 18 to 20. No one has been arrested yet. Community Policing Forum spokesperson Julian Unthank said the incident appeared to be gang-related. “These were young victims believed to be from Malibu who were standing on a corner when a taxi came past and started shooting at them,” Unthank said. “We have appealed to the cluster commander to have police members who were removed from the area deployed back into Kleinvlei. “Kleinvlei is a hot spot at the moment. “We also have a problem with residents being fearful of sharing information with police or the CPF to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book,” he added.
