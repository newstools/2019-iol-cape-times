Johannesburg - Cosatu and its affiliate, the SA Society of Bank Officials (Sasbo) have been granted leave to appeal the Labour Court judgment interdicting planned protest action against job losses and the country's economic crisis. Judge Hilary Rabkin-Naiker granted the federation and its affiliate leave to appeal her ruling halting their planned protests which were scheduled for last Friday and on Monday next week. "Application for leave to appeal my order, and to oppose such application already been made by the parties were still pending despite the fact that reasons for my order were still pending," reads Rabkin-Naiker's judgment. She said given the importance of the matter she would take the unusual step leave of granting the order stating that "leave to appeal the order and judgment in this matter is granted". Rabkin-Naiker reaffirmed the importance of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). "Vukani! Wake up!" she told Nedlac in her judgment. Sasbo had planned a national shutdown of the financial services sector over job losses while Cosatu wanted to protest over the nation's economic crisis. The federation is unhappy with retrenchments across all sectors while company executives are getting exorbitant salaries. Business Unity SA was successful in its bid to interdict both Cosatu and Sasbo protests last week. Political Bureau
