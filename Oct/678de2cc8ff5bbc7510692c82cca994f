Cape Town – Mayor Dan Plato was joined by the City’s solid waste staff in Langa on another stop on his drive to tackle illegal dumping and grime. Intended to educate the public about keeping communities clean, the Keep Cape Town Clean campaign was launched in March and has been successful in having a meaningful impact in communities across the metropole. It has led to clean-ups by various organisations in their respective communities. "I am glad to see that the importance of this message continues to spread and will lead to a sustained change in the way residents dispose of their refuse. "I hope communities which have been cleaned through this campaign understand the value and take pride in keeping their neighbourhoods neat and tidy," said Plato. "In the January adjustment budget, I allocated an additional R115 million to help tackle grime and we now need to keep the momentum of the successes so far. "Our staff in solid waste management carry out weekly refuse removal, but our ultimate goal is to get communities to do their part too. "Illegal dumping is harmful and against the law. Vehicles used in illegal dumping can be confiscated and a release fee of nearly R16 000 will be charged, over-and-above the fines issued for dumping." To report illegal dumping, call 0860 103 089.
