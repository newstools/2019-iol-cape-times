“The day hospital has only been closed once before this closure as a result of protest in the Hangberg area. If it was so unsafe and inaccessible how did the primary school and high school staff and pupils access their schools?” “The people want the day hospital opened and not a provisional plan. The department must not use the recent protest as an excuse for them failing to deliver on this plan for a PolyClinic, eight years later, now seeking to fast track it because of the urgency of not having a facility,” said Roscoe Jacobs. The centre has been closed since September 17, when residents protested following an eviction order issued to a resident, shutting down the construction site of a City electricity depot on land earmarked for housing. Provincial health department spokesperson Natalie Watlington said: “This is the 10th incident of protesting in two years and has had an impact on the safety of the staff. "Staff safety is a primary concern. The department is trying everything within its power to ensure that continued health service delivery takes place.” For medical emergencies, residents can contact 10177. Cape Times
