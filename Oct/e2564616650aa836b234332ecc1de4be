Ntamo signed a two-year lease with another sub-leaser, Wurmbosch Wormery and Organics, in 2017 to lease part of Plaas 502X. He has since found that the land belonging to the municipality was originally leased to Groothoek Trust for 50 years. Ntamo has refused to leave, saying: “I left my job and applied to the municipality for months to get a piece of land. Nothing happened and an official told me to ask one of the leasers of municipal land. "Wurmbosch owner Jors Opperman gave me an opportunity when no one else did to start my sawmill. It came out last year that the Stellenbosch municipality may review long-term leases of their land and it was discovered that the subleasing was never approved,” he said. Ntamo said the electricity and water was turned off in August and he had to turn to the municipality, who he alleged that did very little to resolve the problem. Opperman admitted to leasing part of the property to Ntamo, as it was beneficial to him as part of the agreement allowed him the sawmill waist for his organic composting business. Opperman said he has to leave the property, which would cost him close to R1 million, while the legal occupant, the Groothoek Trust, had received close to R90 000 per month from the four businesses which subleased the property. Groothoek Trustee Trevor Strydom said: “By agreement, the business relationship terminated on August 31 (2019) and Wurmbosch was informed that in terms of the contract, vacant possession is to be provided/restored by no later than the end of October 2019, which Wurmbosch undertook to do.” Cape Times
