Cape Town - Western Cape police have confirmed that the body of a woman recovered in Voëlklip near Herold’s Bay is that of Heidi Scheepers, who went missing last week with her two young children. Scheepers' body was recovered on Saturday afternoon, two days after that of her two-year-old son, Hugo, was recovered. Scheepers, 35, reportedly lived close to the Voëlklip beach where she, her six-year-old daughter Cuzette and two-year-old son Hugo went missing after going for a walk on the beach at about 6pm on Tuesday. Scheepers had driven to the beach in a charcoal VW Caravelle TDI minibus, with the registration CAW66036. The vehicle has since been recovered and will be examined by authorities. Southern Cape police spokesperson Captain Malcom Pojie on Tuesday morning confirmed that the identification process was completed on Monday. "The identification of the mother that was recovered from the ocean near Herolds Bay on Saturday was done yesterday [Monday]. It is confirmed that it is the body of Heidi Scheepers, the mother of the two children. "As I've said, weather permitting, the search will continue this morning. However, we've already placed people on lookout points... in an effort to find the six-year-old that's still missing," he said.
