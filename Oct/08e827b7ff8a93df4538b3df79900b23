This comes just as the clock ticks for the council to decide the fate of the Velodrome at the end of the month. Member of the Kenridge Ratepayers Association, Leandra Khoury said: “We were actually not aware that a decision would be made by the end of the month. We have been strongly opposed to the proposal and to the development. The problem that we have is that for years, the City has allowed the place to become rundown and has not maintained it.” The City’s public participation process which concluded at the end of August received a mere 270 comments. Devmet Property Developments, which acquired the property, had been in a dispute with the City after it was required to pay R25million to the City 18 months prior to the commencement of trading. At a full council meeting in October 2010, approval was given for the city to award a R3billion tender to establish retail, business, residential, hotel and conference facilities in the Velodrome precinct. Mayco member for economic opportunities and asset management James Vos said: It is important to note that the last public engagement was conducted in terms of the municipal asset transfer regulations. The City, being cognisant of the public interest, published an extended public participation period (60 days) and in addition convened a public meeting which was well attended.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
