Cape Town – A 20-year-old man was seriously injured on Tuesday morning after being knocked down by a MyCiTi bus in Milnerton. City Traffic Service spokesperson Richard Coleman said the 20-year-old man was in a serious condition and medics had to attend to him on the scene. The accident happened in the R27 direction around 7.10am Traffic delays were caused due to the bus and right lane being obstructed in Marine Drive after Greyton Road. In August, a 30-year-old Riebeeckstrand Primary schoolteacher in Melkbosstrand was knocked down and killed by a MyCiTi bus a few kilometres away on Otto du Plessis Drive near Sunset Beach. In 2015, a Woodstock woman, Sylvana Lasker, was left devastated after her mother was killed when a MyCiTi bus knocked her over in Table View. Her mother, the 45-year-old Amiena Easton, had been at Bayside Mall in Table View and was on her way to catch a taxi to her home in Brooklyn when the incident occurred. She said a witness told her that Easton had several shopping bags in her hands as she crossed the road to catch a taxi to her home in Brooklyn. However, she didn’t make it home and ended up at Groote Schuur Hospital instead. Six days later she died of her injuries.
