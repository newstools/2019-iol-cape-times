Liedeman was one of four small-scale farmers who signed the long-awaited lease agreements for mixed farming in the west coast town through the Mamre Communal Property Association (MCPA). The MCPA received 58 applications from the Mamre land reform beneficiary community to lease communal property for mixed farming use. Liedeman and his wife, Virginia, have been farming on their smallholding for 15 years. “We mainly farm with cattle but we also have chickens and some horses on our land. “Having long-term leases gives us the surety that we never had before,” said Liedeman. He said that as a family they could now make long-term plans to expand and grow their farming operation, which was never available to them before. The Liedeman family received 104 hectares, with Ronald Arendse (4a), Marco Vraagom (2a) and Gerald Loock (5a). The lease agreements would be entered into on explaining the terms and conditions as well as the payment terms for property usage rights for a period of nine years and 11 months, subject to conditions. The association’s chairperson Wilfred Johannes said the signing of the lease agreements ensured advantages and benefits to increase the size of small farming and businesses. They would also enable the farmers to access funding. Cape Times
