Cape Town â€“ Police forensic investigators are probing the death of a person whose body was found on the Camps Bay side of Table Mountain this morning. Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) spokesperson Johann Marais said on Sunday: "A body was found earlier this morning near Woody ravine on the Camps Bay side of Table Mountain. "SAPS and forensic experts are on the scene to investigate. Rescue crews will assist in recovering the body once police have completed their work on the scene. "Details surrounding the incident are unclear at this stage. It (the rescue) will be staged from Theresa Avenue." In another incident, Marais said they have also been called to the mountain above Kirstenbosch Gardens, where a climber fell 10 metres from a rock face, fracturing his leg. Skymed traced the patient in between rocks, airlifting him to safety. The injured patient has been taken to hospital. "Skymed was deployed and just after 10 the helicopter traced the patient," Marais said. The injured hiker was dropped off at the entrance to Kirstenbosch Gardens, where a waiting ambulance transported him to hospital. Cape Times
