Arendse filed a formal complaint this week calling for police to “immediately invoke the institution of the expeditious procedure” against officers. This comes after police officer Charl Kinnear - the investigating officer into the extortion case against Nafiz Modack, Colin Booysen, Ashley Fields, Jacques Cronje and Carl Lakay - lodged a complaint in which he asked for an urgent investigation into crimes allegedly committed by the six officers relating to the abuse of state property and resources in a personal attack under the pretence that they were investigating various other police officials. Earlier this year, the complaint was found to be legitimate by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate before it referred the matter to the National Prosecuting Authority for a decision to prosecute during July. According to Arendse, the six officers are still operating illegally. “This rogue ‘crime intel unit’ operated as a law unto themselves bordering on abuse of power, knowingly facilitating or being aware of the commissioning of criminal acts, defeating the ends or course of justice, ruthless subversion of the law and/or serious misconduct by bringing the police service into disrepute by acts of gross dereliction of duty," he said. Police did not comment by deadline yesterday. Cape Times
