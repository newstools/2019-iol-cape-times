The City of Cape Town’s legal representative, Ron Paschke, said in court on Tuesday, the Cape Argus reported: “One of the myths is that development(s) will be allowed to endanger the aquifer; that’s not true. "The aquifer will be protected through the application of the City’s stormwater management policy, adopted through international precedent that incorporates how urban developments should be managed and the sustainable urban drainage system." "Paschke also slammed the applicants’ claims that farming is beneficial for the aquifer. “In fact, farming is more likely to do harm than development. The farming practising survey shows that the soil in Philippi requires almost hydroponic cultivation. “It requires massive amounts of fertilisation. Its sand doesn’t have the nutrients, and it needs massive fertilisation. Where does this fertilisation go? It goes into the groundwater and results in high pollution of the groundwater,” Paschke said. Cape Times
