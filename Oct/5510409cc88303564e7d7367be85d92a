Speaking about her acceptance into the Cool Training course being hosted in Bavaria in Germany from October 7-22, the young and optimistic De Villiers said: “I’m really excited to have been selected for training in greener cooling solutions. Currently, I work in the health sector, so we look at the heating and cooling systems within hospitals and clinics - this kind of training is vital to the kinds of projects I’m working on, which require the installation of more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment.” De Villiers currently works for the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works. Stemming from a successful bilateral relationship spanning over 20 years, the Free State of Bavaria and Western Cape government embarked on a partnership project on the “transition to climate-friendly refrigeration and air-conditioning” in 2017. The project saw the two governments working closely to reduce emissions of harmful refrigeration chemicals to the atmosphere, in line with the 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol: Hydrofluorocarbons Phase-down. Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning air quality management director Dr Joy Leaner said: “With rising temperatures and extreme weather patterns, the demand for refrigeration and air- conditioning has escalated. “Our agreement with Bavaria allows us to create a platform to share knowledge and skills in introducing more climate-friendly refrigerants towards mitigating the sources that contribute to climate change.” The industrial refrigeration and air-conditioning sector contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions, because they make use of fluorinated gases as refrigerants, she added. The two-week training programme also includes visits to Bavarian companies showcasing the use of modern and environmentally friendly climate and cooling technologies. Cape Times
