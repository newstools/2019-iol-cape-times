Daniels’ family has created a Backabuddy campaign to crowdfund for donations to assist and support payment for logistics and investigative services rendered to them. There has been no progress in the case despite plans to coordinate a thorough grid search of the entire Ho Chi Minh City where Daniels was last seen on July 5. This is also despite a South African allegedly having spotted Daniels outside a mosque in Vietnam in late September. Daniels’ mother Faheema Adams, who flew to Vietnam shortly after her son went missing, previously said: “So it’s the three of us in a city of 20 million people. ‘‘Thanks to social media I could spread the news in all the expat and local groups - everyone is on the lookout.” A hopeful Adams said: “Every day is a day too long. He needs medical attention ASAP. ‘‘Without medical attention he might be suffering from amnesia and might not even know his own name or that he is a South African.” The search has come with its own challenges after reports about her son’s safety and condition, including alleged involvement in organ trafficking, cults and drugs, had caused Adams to suffer a mild heart attack in August. The mother of John Bothma, 23, who also went missing while teaching English in Vietnam, flew to Ho Chi Minh City to assist Adams.
