The Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania followed, triumphing at the Athlone campus. CPUT issued the preliminary results yesterday, as votes from the District Six campus were expected to be announced today. EFFSC acting provincial secretary Songeze Phahlindlela said they were confident the District Six campus would also remain under their control. “We are expecting to dominate again, judging by the work we did this year. “We delivered all that we promised the students and made history by launching the Uphephela Drivers Learner’s Licence programme. “This was a project that was well accepted and proved that we meant it when we said we want to change students’ lives,” said Phahlindlela. More than 600 student campuses were registered with the programme.
