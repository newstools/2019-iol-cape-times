Cape Town - Parliament's portfolio committee on police on Tuesday called for the increased visibility of officers on South Africa's streets, especially in crime hot spot areas, in the wake of the murder of 13 people in Cape Town's sprawling Philippi township at the weekend. The killings are symptomatic of a complex socio-economic problem requiring an urgent and multifaceted approach, the committee's chairwoman Tina Joemat-Pettersson said in a statement decrying the country's escalating murder rate. The police minister and senior management of the South African Police Service (SAPS) must move with speed to implement the promise made by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his recent state of the nation address to increase visibility, she said. Furthermore, SAPS must strengthen the strategies intended to fight the proliferation of illegal guns, Joemat-Pettersson added. The portfolio committee also emphasised the need for strident strategies to curb gender based violence which it said continued to be a worrying problem in South Africa, citing the killing of six women among the 13 people murdered in Philippi. “Violence against women remains one of the most repugnant forms of crime in the country and cannot be left unabated,” Joemat-Pettersson said. The fight against crime required a broader approach that included dealing with unemployment, poverty and the scourge of substance abuse, she said. African News Agency (ANA)
