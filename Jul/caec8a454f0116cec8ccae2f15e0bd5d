Cape Town – Nando's Western Cape teamed up with the Cape Times to donate 100 backpacks, filled with toys and stationery for underprivileged children, at the Dryden Primary School in Salt River on Mandela Day yesterday. Christelle Scott, Regional Marketing Manager of Nando's Western Cape, explained that the Nando's regional team sourced and packed the backpacks, which are made from re-purposed Nando's menu boards. The school principal, Mr Joubert, thanked the Cape Times and Nando's teams as the children aged six to eight were so excited to be visited by the Nando's Mascot and receive their backpacks. Mandela Day serves as a reminder that we all have the the ability to change the world through small actions. The sheer joy and excited faces of the children was heartwarming. "Let us reach out to the children. Let us do whatever we can to support their fight to rise above their pain and suffering." – Nelson Mandela Cape Times
