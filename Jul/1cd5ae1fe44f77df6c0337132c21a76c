This response from Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz comes after confirmation by national police commissioner Khehla Sitole that he had talks with Jula about the prospect of taking up the position of commissioner in KwaZulu-Natal. Sitole also emphasised that the consultation process has not yet been concluded. Fritz said: “I look forward to the amiable and transparent appointment of a provincial commissioner who will set aside internal politics and immediately prioritise the recent spate of gang-related violence and criminality in the Western Cape. “It is imperative that the new provincial commissioner be a person of the highest integrity who is not involved in any of the factions that are currently destroying SAPS in the Western Cape.” Controversy has erupted between Jula and senior officers, as well as Solidarity and the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) who claimed that he removed most generals and replaced them with officers from Kwazulu-Natal. Jula was also criticised for establishing the Major Offences Reaction Team (Mort) which operates in parallel with the Anti-Gang Unit. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
