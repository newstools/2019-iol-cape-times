Nyanga is notorious as the country's murder capital. “SAPS Nyanga polices three areas - Browns Farm, Crossroads and Nyanga. The station would like to advise e-hailing service drivers to rather concentrate on other areas. "In some cases, women make a call and when the driver arrives to pick up the client, a different person would hijack and rob the driver. "Hot spots incldue Govan Mbeki Road (Philippi), Bristol and Sheffield Roads in Browns Farm, Klipfontein Road, Miller and Eisleben Roads in Nyanga, and Crossroads.
