Cape Town – Mandela Day is a special day to many in South Africa, and offers people the chance of giving back to the community. On Thursday, the Cape Times, in association with MoiMooi Beauty Spa and the Palms Lifestyle Centre, hosted an event for Mandela Day for the civil servants of the City of Cape Town, who selflessly give so much of their time ensuring that we are kept safe and well cared for. The goal for the day, which was held at The Palms, 145 Sir Lowry Road, in Woodstock, was to create a fun and stress-free atmosphere, leaving guests feeling relaxed and appreciated. The attendees were treated to a day of spa pampering at MoiMooi, sweet treats from Bones Restaurant, coffee from Byblos and a drumming session among other surprise activities. The Bookery had a drop-off point for books that will be donated to a worthy cause. Cape Times
