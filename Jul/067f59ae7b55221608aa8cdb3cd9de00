Kannemeyer reminisced over his friendship with Ortell as one of “closeness and fatherly support” during his deepest challenges and failures. “I will surely miss him as the organisation and the municipality have missed him over the last number of years,” said Kannemeyer.

Ortell served as executive mayor of Stellenbosch Municipality between 2002 and 2006 and was a respected and well known figure in Stellenbosch. “We will keep the Ortell family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,” said Van Deventer.
