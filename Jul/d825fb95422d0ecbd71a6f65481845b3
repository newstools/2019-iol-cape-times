The Two Oceans Aquarium, in partnership with Gansbaai Academy, Simon’s Town High and South Peninsula High schools, had launched the pilot, which has been offered as an extra subject two afternoons a week. The subject is also available to interested Grade 10 learners from neighbouring schools and surrounding areas. Russell Stevens, head of education at the Two Oceans Aquarium, said the gazetting was an exciting moment for marine education in South Africa. “It is a first for us, and a first for Africa. The curriculum is already recognised around the world as one to strive towards. ‘‘Officials within the education department have shown nothing but support, enthusiasm and a ‘let’s make this happen’ attitude as they have seen the hard work which has been put into the development of the curriculum and teacher support materials by the Two Oceans Aquarium teaching team. ‘‘We look forward to the official pilot in schools where the Grade 10s of 2020 will take marine sciences as one of their subjects for their matric in 2022.” Stevens said they developed “an extremely successful” partnership with the Department of Basic Education, the Gauteng Department of Education and the Western Cape Education Department. “These students have expressed an understanding of how important the ocean is as we face the climate crisis. “We have been inspired by them and their commitment to being the change that they want to see in the world,” he said.
