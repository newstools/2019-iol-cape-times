Cape Town – The serious collision on Tuesday morning on the M6 Victoria Road between Camps Bay and Llandudno was the second calamitous incident to have taken place on this stretch of road within 12 hours. Reduced visibility due to fog is among the reasons believed to have resulted in two vehicles colliding this morning near Oudekraal, with one catching fire. A man sustained serious injuries and two women were injured, while another motorist fled the scene, Cape Town Traffic spokesperson Richard Coleman said. It had caused a traffic nightmare because the road had to be closed temporarily. Fire services on Monday night had to use specialised equipment to free a man after a three-vehicle collision on Victoria Road. "Medics found the three vehicles in the middle of the road. One of the vehicles had caught alight in the collision. "Medics assessed the patients and found one man lying trapped inside his vehicle in a critical condition," said ER24, who had responded to a call at 8.31pm. "A woman was found lying near another vehicle in a serious condition, while a second woman had sustained moderate injuries."
