Cape Town – There was an increase in law enforcement officials deployed at Cape Flats schools opening today. This follows a meeting that took place on Sunday between Premier Alan Winde, Safety and Security MEC Albert Fritz and the Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum (CPF) cluster. The purpose of the additional deployments is to safeguard learners returning to school over the next two weeks. During this meeting requests were made to: – Deploy School Resource Officers (SRO) at schools as per the SRO Deployment plan; – For SROs to physically visit all schools in gang-afflicted areas. SROs are to visit the Principal of each school in person; and – Provide reports to the Transport Management Centre (TMC) Joint Operations Centre (JOC) regarding visits and deployments. "I am very glad that the Western Cape government was able to meet with CPF prior to the reopening of schools to safeguard the young people of this province. "Amongst the numerous communities that will benefit from increased deployments are Philippi, Kraaifontein, Nyanga, Manenberg and Lentegeur. “I further call on Neighbourhood Watches to contribute to this initiative by patrolling schools within their communities during school hours. We must ensure the safety of our schools and the learners who attend them.” The Department of Community Safety will continue to provide the necessary oversight to safeguard the most vulnerable communities and learners in the province, Fritz said.
