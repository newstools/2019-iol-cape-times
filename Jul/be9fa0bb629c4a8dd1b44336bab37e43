Participants of the youth-led non-profit organisation, Enabling Disability Education Nationally (Eden), completed the 13-day walk from Durban. Omphile Mangwagape, 32, Dennis Tolo, 30, Samuel Modise, 27, Sithokozile Msomi, 29, Brian Makama, 28, Sylvester Myambo, 28, Xolani Bala, 27 and Lulama Bala, 27, aimed to raise R500 000. Eden co-founder Omphile Mangwagape, who lives with a mild cognitive impairment, said: “The walk was both inspiring and challenging at the same time. “What kept us going was the fact that we’re helping achieve accessibility to education.” Though it has received some funding, the NPO is still struggling to obtain the amount needed to roll out the educational programme. “We haven’t raised enough because the crowdfunding platforms had technical issues,” Mangwagape said. In 2017, the organisation donated proceedings raised during a similar walk to two schools for hearing impaired and disabled youth. The organisation said it had identified Fanang Diatla Centre for the Disabled and Kusasa Lethu Trust as their beneficiaries for this year.
