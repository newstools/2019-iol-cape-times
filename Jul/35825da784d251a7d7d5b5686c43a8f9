Cape Town – Temporary relief has been brought to residents of the Moravian Mission Station in Wupperthal, near Clanwilliam, who lost everything in a devastating fire at the beginning of the year. Yesterday, 53 temporary residential units were handed to the residents. The spokesperson for the provincial Human Settlements Department, Marcellino Martin, said: “Fifty-three temporary residential units were handed over. "The structures were completed at the end of June and went through various tests to ensure quality.” Martin said the department had not made plans to erect permanent structures, as the land was privately owned. In March, the department approved funding for the provision of temporary modular housing units and associated infrastructure in Wupperthal. A service provider was appointed for the provision of the temporary structures. Unlike other temporary structures, the homes have two bedrooms and a bathroom, an open-plan kitchen and a living area, with electrical distribution and lighting, water supply and waste disposal. Wupperthal is a small town nestled in the Cederberg Mountains. On December 30, an inferno destroyed 53 of 113 homes, nearly leaving the cultural heritage in ruins. Insurers assessed the damaged church buildings, and the preliminary findings estimated repair costs at R20million. Most of the buildings were so badly damaged that they had to be demolished in the interests of public safety. The area is rich in natural treasures, with numerous indigenous species as well as cultural and historical buildings. Cape Times
