Cape Town – Businesses in Stellenbosch would have received news of more reports of rock falls in the Franschhoek Pass following overnight rain with even more despondency. The Cape Times reported last week that the closure of the pass for safety reasons adversely affected trade after the Stellenbosch municipality had closed the pass indefinitely following rock falls caused by torrential rain and gale-force winds. A motorist and his passenger had a narrow escape after the first rock fall, which blocked the roadway. Western Cape Transport Department spokesperson Jandre Bakker said a geo-technical team is investigating the situation, the SABC reported. He added that the department would determine its next step once an assessment report has been received. Tony le Roux, who is in the leather trade in Stellenbosch, said the closure had forced businesses to pay additional funds for goods to be delivered via alternative routes. “Hundreds of businesses are being affected by this closure and we are no closer to knowing how long it will last,” said Le Roux. “This is placing a huge strain on financial operations because hundreds of rand have to be spent on petrol to cover the extra distance (on) alternative routes, (including) toll fees.” Employees who had hitch-hiked to work in neighbouring areas had been given lifts through the pass by vehicles owned by businesses. “What then happens to them now? Hopefully something can be done,” said Le Roux. Cape Times
