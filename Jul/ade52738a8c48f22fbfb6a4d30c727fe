Following the recent announcement of a 6% year-on-year increase in the recycling of PET plastic bottles, national industry body the PET Recycling Company (Petco) unveiled its recycling champions, which included those making strides in sustainability at grassroots level. Petco said the province led the national list, with nine category winners, including Rocco da Silva, 9, and Franschhoekâ€™s Jocelyn van der Ross, who overcame unemployment and three fires to run a successful recycling business. Da Silva, from Somerset West, started The Future Kids Club, which aims to encourage youth in his area to participate in monthly beach clean-ups. Over the past 14 months, members have collected in excess of 950kg of rubbish off a local 400m stretch of beach. Other Western Cape winners include Hout Bay community project Thrive, UCT academic Takunda Chitaka and Plastics SA environmental manager John Kieser. The Drakenstein Municipality scooped the award for local authority recycling innovation.
