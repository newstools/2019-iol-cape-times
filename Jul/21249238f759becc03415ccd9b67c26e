NPO Mustadafin Foundation is hosting Operation Anti-Freeze for Zoar, about 354km from Cape Town. Mustadafin Foundation spokesperson Shameemah de Jongh said the town had an average winter temperature of 10 degrees celsius, and they were calling on the public to donate food, clothes and blankets for the freezing town’s residents. “The town has a high unemployment rate, as the drought has affected farmers,” said De Jongh. ‘‘We are in liaison with the municipality and have met with the mayor as well as development workers. When visiting Zoar we could feel the ice in our bones, and felt the need to provide relief to this community,” De Jongh added. The biggest employer of residents is a cheese and powder factory about 20km from the town. On July 6 the foundation planned to distribute 3 000 blankets, 600 food and party packs for the children, and 600 hot meals.
