Cape Town â€“ A bread delivery truck was hijacked in Mfuleni on the R300 just before Stock Road, the City said on Wednesday. Law Enforcement officers on patrol who came across the bread delivery truck discovered that the driver and co-worker had been locked in the back of the truck. The robbers had broken open the safe and removed an undisclosed amount of cash. The driver and his workers were unharmed and the bread left untouched. Yesterday, a roadworthy check by two members of the Road Haulage Unit turned out to be much more when the vehicle they tested was confirmed stolen, the City's Traffic Service said. They had been doing vehicle checkpoint duty in the cold and wet weather on the corners of Paarden Island and Cumberland roads in Paarden Island. The vehicle, a red and white Nissan Skyline with sporty decals, caught the attention of the officers when the driver revved the vehicle while making a U-turn and spun the wheels. The officers immediately stopped the driver and after providing the control centre with the full details of the vehicle, it was discovered that it had been stolen in Kraaifontein. When officers questioned the driver, he alleged that the vehicle belonged to his brother. The driver was arrested and taken to the Maitland police station.
