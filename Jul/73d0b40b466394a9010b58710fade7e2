The Thusong Community Outreach programme, which had various government departments, the Breede Valley Municipality and other institutions on board, aimed to address limited access of services and information to residents. Hosted by the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the local government department, 625 people from Avian Park and surrounding areas such as Skerpenheuwel, Aan de Doorns, Riverview, Rhoodewal, Hexpark and Zwelethemba attended last week. SAHRC advocacy and research officer Lesego Raphalane said a range of issues was discussed. “The Thusong outreach is an integrated service delivery vehicle used to ensure that services get to reach outlying areas in the province, with Worcester one of those areas. ‘‘Residents raised issues of access to justice that the commission will look into and general service delivery. Some residents complained about the lack of employment or job opportunities.” Raphalane said interventions were designed to raise awareness on human rights, bring services to the people, and build sustainable working relations with local role-players. Provincial Health Department Cape Winelands spokesperson Sandra Maritz said: “Boland Hospice, a funded partner of Western Cape Department of Health, participated in the outreach event. Focus was on providing healthcare information.”
