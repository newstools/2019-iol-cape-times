Voorbrug High School in Delft won the B Section of the competition, in which six schools and eight community teams participated. The other schools in the competition were Delft Technical School in Delft, Heideveld, St Andrews from Elsies River and Mountview in Grassy Park. The Delft Law Enforcement School Resource Unit’s safety and security directorate and the Western Province Marching Association (WPMA) hosted the event. The competition aimed to strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and residents. Mayco member for safety JP Smith said the competition gives young people the opportunity to showcase their talent and in turn encourage others to form part of the initiative. “A marching band provides a unique opportunity to boost the self-esteem of those who participate and foster a sense of unity and belonging. A marching band provides another family to which all band members can belong. ‘‘In the band, they learn values and standards and they learn teamwork and how to appreciate their fellow band members,” Smith said.
