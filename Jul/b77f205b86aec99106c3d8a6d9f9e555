Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said: “We confirm that the 74-year-old father of our very own detective Warrant Officer Nico Heerschap was shot twice and (killed) near his home. “The motive of the killing is the subject of our investigation.” The Hawks Serious Organised Crime investigation team was on the scene, combing the area for clues at the seaside property. No one has been arrested. Melkbosstrand Community Policing Forum (CPF) spokesperson Sammy Kleynhans said: “This is obviously very shocking and we feel for the family. "As far as it is understood, the victim was about to take his grandchild to school when he pulled his vehicle into the driveway. “This is when suspects shot at him and then drove off. The victim’s grandchild was not in the vehicle at the time of the shooting,” said Kleynhans. Kleynhans urged the public not to share information that is unconfirmed via social media. “It is frustrating that people are sharing things on social media that they think is the truth. Information about the murder is out there already but people are speculating with no thought of the repercussions for the families affected,” said Kleynhans.
