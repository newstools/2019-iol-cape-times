Cape Town – Four armed males robbed The Diamond Works store opposite the Cape Town International Convention Centre on Friday morning. Wearing masks and workmen's overalls, they entered the shop in the Metropolitan building, which is under construction, and forced their way passed security, leaving with an undisclosed amount of jewellery. No injuries were reported and the four men fled in a Mercedes-Benz, which had a driver waiting outside, Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said. The Diamond Works institute, on the corners of Lower Long and Walter Sisulu streets, is described as a place where one can "witness, first hand, the art of diamond cutting and the careful craftsmanship of jewellery manufacturing from our skilled professionals – all whilst enjoying a complimentary glass of sparkling wine".
