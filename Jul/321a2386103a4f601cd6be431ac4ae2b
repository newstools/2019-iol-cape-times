Cape Town – One person died and two others were injured in a head-on collision last night after a motorist lost control of his car between Stellenbosch and Paarl. Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa said the crash occurred in stormy conditions, the SABC reported. “We had a head-on collision between Klapmuts and Kraaifontein. In this incident the driver of a Mazda SUV lost control. He went through the middle island and landed in front of an oncoming vehicle on the other side of the road. "The driver of the SUV died in this crash and the two occupants in the other vehicle were injured and taken to hospital,” Africa said.
