Cape Town – Residents of Blikkiesdorp embarked on violent protest action in Delft on Friday in an attempt to draw attention to the high levels of crime, poverty and unemployment prevalent in the community. The protesters burnt tyres and stoned vehicles, with several roads having to be closed off. The action station commander of the Delft police station's personal vehicle was one of those to be stoned, the SABC reported. The roads have since been reopened, the City of Cape Town said at noon. Delft Community Policing Forum chairperson Charles George said soldiers arrived in the area to monitor the situation. "It’s just over 300 people that took to the streets this morning. The acting commander was en route to the station when he was also notified about the protest and when he arrived, his personal vehicle was stoned. "There is tyres burning on Symphony Main Road and Hindle Road," George said this morning. Last week, more than 200 angry Blikkiesdorp residents marched to their local police station demanding cops put an end to the bloodshed. Cape Times
