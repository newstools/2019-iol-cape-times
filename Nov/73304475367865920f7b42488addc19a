Speaking at a university meeting last week, Heunis also said he would no longer be prepared to remain as president unless rector and vice-chancellor Wim de Villiers and council chairperson George Steyn resigned. A senior advocate, Heunis represented lobby group Gelyke Kanse during Constitutional Court proceedings to set aside the 2016 language policy of Stellenbosch University, which would see English being elevated above Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. Their attempt failed. Following the apex court's finding, allegations surfaced that De Villiers tried to sway the court by offering Justice Cameron the chancellor position. Retired appeals judge Burton Fourie is now heading an investigation into the allegation. Heunis said: “It was with a sense of utter disbelief and astonishment that we had to learn that the rector had telephonically contacted one of 10 judges who presided over a matter in which the rector himself was the first respondent, to discuss with him the possibility of making himself available as a candidate for the position of chancellor of the university before judgment was handed down.” De Villiers said: “At this stage, it will be inappropriate for me to make any further comments regarding this investigation. The university will communicate further on this matter once the report has served before the university's council.” Cape Times
