Cape Town - The suspect arrested in connection with the murder of Jesse Hess and her grandfather, and the rape of a 16-year-old girl in Hanover Park earlier this week, was apparently well known to both families. David van Boven appeared at the Wynberg Magistrates Court on Friday after he was arrested in Struisbaai on Thursday. He was positively identified by the childâ€™s mother who caught him in the act. The state prosecutor told the court that the accused was well known to his victims. A police source added that he had been taken in for questioning soon after the murders of Jesse and her grandfather Chris, but was not arrested because authorities were waiting for the results of DNA tests.  The breakthrough for police came on Monday when he struck again. In the Hess case, it is believed that he is a second cousin and that this could account for their being no sign of forced entry at the murder scene.  A small group had gathered outside the court to show their support for Jesse and the raped teenager. The rape case has been postponed to February 14 for further investigation and DNA results.  The court also heard that Van Boven had been out on parole for charges of rape and drug-related crimes. Walking up from the holding cells Van Boven put his grey hoodie hood to cover his head. Once before the magistrate he removed it and did not make eye contact with those in the gallery.  Van Boven opted not to apply for bail and will stay in police custody. The defence said they understood that other charges would be brought against him. shanice.naidoo@inl.co.za Weekend Argus
