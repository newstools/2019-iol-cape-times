Cape Town – A second suspect has appeared in court in connection with the alleged rape of an 18-year-old Mossel Bay schoolgirl. A 17-year-old boy has already appeared in the Mossel Bay Magistrate's Court on a charge of rape. He was released into his parents' care and is due to appear in court again on January 12, the Mossel Bay Advertiser reported. The second suspect appeared in court on Wednesday and was also released into his parents' care. The November 16 incident was filmed on a cellphone during a house party and the footage – in which three boys were allegedly taking turns to rape the Grade 11 pupil – was shared with several children from the school. It is believed the girl fell asleep after drinking alcohol at the party. When she woke up, she discovered that she was undressed and had been raped, police said. A friend informed her that footage of the incident had been distributed to fellow pupils. The faces of the three suspects were visible in the video. The third suspect is still at large. According to police, the teenager was not at home when they went to arrest him. Cape Times
