Cape Town – A truck that jack-knifed on the M3 on Thursday night, while trying to make a U-turn, at the corner of Newlands Avenue on Rhodes Drive has caused major traffic delays all through Friday morning. “Last night, the driver of a heavy-duty truck tried making a U-turn on the M3 at Rhodes Drive," Cape Town Traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said at 11.29am. "He lost control of the vehicle and it jack-knifed in the intersection. No one was injured. "Given that the incident happened at night, it was not possible to conduct a proper assessment of the situation. "Currently, efforts are under way to secure the load (empty glass bottles) so that the truck can be moved out of the roadway. In the interim, all traffic is being diverted. "The M3 towards Cape Town is now closed at Constantia Main Road. The M3 direction Muizenberg is closed at Newlands Avenue.” At 11.44am, Bezuidenhout said one lane had been opened on the M3 south-bound and at 12.51pm two lanes were opened. Earlier on Friday, before 6am, a motorist was killed in a car crash on the N1 near Monte Vista, causing traffic delays going into the CBD. Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa said the crash occurred near Giel Basson Drive when two cars collided. The roadway into the CBD had to be closed, but has since been reopened.
