On Thursday, Prasa spokesperson Nana Zenani said they were alarmed by the two-day illegal protest that ensued after Prasa cancelled all security contracts as at the end of October. “Prasa has consistently, since June this year, communicated its intention to terminate the contracts after the former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, found in her ‘derailed’ report on Prasa that all Prasa security contracts were irregular”. Zenani said the matter had also been taken up by the Special Investigation Unit with the intention of thoroughly investigating the contracts and holding those involved to account. She said over the past two days, Prasa had witnessed the employees of those former security companies protesting at Prasa premises, blocking access and making it difficult for Prasa employees and visitors to leave the premises through all the gates. “Police were called to the scene over the past two days, culminating in the use of stun grenades by the police today to disperse the protesters and allow employees and visitors to leave the premises.” She said the actions of the security companies’ employees at Prasa premises were not only illegal, but they flew in the face of all legal processes that could be employed - especially since those companies were not even providing a service to Prasa. According to the service providers, more than 1 000 security personnel who were deployed to safeguard train drivers, commuters and rail infrastructure along the Northern, Southern and Central lines were now facing the very real possibility of being unemployed. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
