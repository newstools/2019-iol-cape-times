Members of Eppa have clashed with the Robben Island Museum (RIM) over an increase in ticket prices for people wanting to visit the historic island. Last week RIM announced: “As of June 1, 2020, Robben Island Museum (RIM) will apply a R50 increase on international tour prices and only a R20 increase on local tour prices. This will result in an increment from R380 for South African citizens to R400; while the non-South African citizens rate will increase from R550 to R600.” Eppa secretary general Mpho Masemola said: “The price hike is nothing but price fixing. RIM is making a visit to Robben Island a middle-class privilege and a capitalist destination.” The former political prisoner said: “While workers’ salaries have not increased, we will strongly condemn the price hike for ordinary South Africans, especially in the light of the uncertainty and unemployment in the country.” In response, the museum’s management said: “As standard annual practice, Robben Island Museum adjusts tariffs for the new financial year. All prices are inclusive of a return ferry trip, guided island and prison tour.” The new standard tariffs will be as follows: R600 ($43/38) for non-South African adults and R300 ($20/16) for non-South African children aged 2 to 18 years. R400 for South African adults and R210 for South African children aged 2 to 18 years. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
