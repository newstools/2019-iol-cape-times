“I am very disturbed by this break-in; we are a godly, vibrant community church. We feed the community and help them wherever we can. "I don’t understand why anyone would steal from those who bring a brighter future to the community,” Adams said. “From now on we will work on tightening the security at the church, and engage with the police officers for high visibility in the area,” she said. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said they were investigating a case of housebreaking. "No arrest has been made yet,” Van Wyk said. Ward Councillor Anthony Moses said the church is well known for doing good. “They have programmes where they rehabilitate youngsters from the community who are drug addicts,” Moses said. “We have tightened up security around the area. We are also installing CCTV cameras on the streets and in church,” Moses said. Last week, The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Belgravia, Athlone, was hit by robbers who made off with valuable brass items, some dating back 120 years.
