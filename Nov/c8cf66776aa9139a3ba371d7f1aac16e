It was an emotional day for me because we hosted it at my former high school which gave so much to me,” said Petersen. “One of my teachers, Mr. Lawrence, was my pillar of strength and gave me everything that a father could give because I grew up without a father. “Playing soccer has basically saved my life from a lot of things as I lived in this area that was - and still is - overrun by gangsters and drugs,” he continues.
