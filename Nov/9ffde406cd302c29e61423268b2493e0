The National Director of Public Prosecutions, Adv Shamila Batohi, and NPA head of Investigative Directorate, Adv Hermione Cronje, are ready to place those who were involved in the theft of more R250 million at Estina Dairy Farm behind bars. Batohi and Cronje made these revelations during a round table discussion with the media at their headquarters in Pretoria on Tuesday. The latest plan to pounce on all implicated individuals comes after charges were withdrawn against eight suspects in November last year due to insufficient evidence to prosecute them. On Monday Cronje, who is responsible for all state capture related cases revealed that her unit - which includes highly experienced Hawks investigators and various private forensic investigators - has gathered enough evidence to reinstate the charges against some of the accused and possibly new suspects. “We are waiting for the last piece of evidence from the United Arab Emirates before we could enroll the case in court,” Cronje said She said the last piece of evidence will be handed to her office before the end of this month. Batohi also revealed that she has revived the Anti-Corruption Task Team (ACTT) to help prosecute various cases in the nine provinces which became dormant following the collapse of the previous ACTT in 2010. “That entity failed,” Batohi said. She said she had roped in the Hawks, Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), the South African Revenue Services (Sars) and various other law enforcement saying they were now ready to prosecute various fraud and corruption cases which happened in municipalities and provincial government departments across the country.
