The school’s deputy principal, Stephen Taylor, said they were incredibly grateful for the donations. “We will foster stronger relations with our school,” said Taylor, who added that the school’s principal, Maurice Hefke, had also thanked the consul-general and the foundation for the generous donation during the handover. Qing said the school had been selected for the donation as its children were from poor backgrounds. It was the fourth time the foundation has made charitable donations this year. “The children often study amidst the sound of gunfire. “Colleagues from the foundation gave the deserving children the special gifts,” Chen Qing said.
