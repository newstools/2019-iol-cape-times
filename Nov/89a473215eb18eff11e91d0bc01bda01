The Western Cape High Court granted the residents the interim relief this week against housing provider Communicare. Resident and chairperson of the Foundation for Community Development Neville Petersen said they welcomed the relief. Tenants now also planned to lodge a criminal charge against Communicare, he said. Communicare spokesperson Michelle Matthee said the Albatross apartment tenants had access to water and electricity; it was only those who forcefully occupied vacant units who were without services. “Our application is before the magistrate’s court for them to be lawfully removed from the premises. “The court provided interim relief to the people who are there unlawfully to be granted access to water. “No final ruling has been made and an interim order was granted in our absence to obtain temporary relief based on the version presented from one side only. We will respect the court order,” Matthee said. City of Cape Town spokesperson Sellecca Lang said the City was looking into the issue. A tenant, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “Communicare does not care about us at all. “We have suffered a lot. Justice must protect us from those who feel like they have the power to do as they wish.” Cape Times
