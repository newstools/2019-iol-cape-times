We want to show our gratitude to them for bringing home the cup and making all of South Africa so proud of them." He added that Cape Town would be the home of the Webb Ellis Cup for the next couple of years. “(On Sunday) residents and motorists are alerted to temporary road closures for the event, which are as follows: Darling Street between Parade and Corporation Streets, Parade Street between Caledon and Darling Streets, Corporation Street between Longmarket and Darling Streets.” Today, from 8am to 5pm, Darling Street between Buitenkant and Lower Plein Street will be closed, with Parade Street between Caledon and Darling Streets and Corporation Street between Longmarket and Darling streets closed for the day. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
