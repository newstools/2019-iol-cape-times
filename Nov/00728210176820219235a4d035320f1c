ANC Chief Whip Jongilizwe Tyatya said: “This anomaly was picked up by auditors and municipal manager Allen Paulse confirmed it during a special council meeting after the ANC asked about it. “We have asked that the matter be investigated even though the municipal manager said it might have been done by mistake when the councillor was loaded on the payroll system,” said Tyatya. “Our question is why was this ‘mistake’ not picked up by our own finance department in the municipality? We want to ensure that the public knows about this as they are the ratepayers.” Oudtshoorn Municipality spokesperson, Ntobeko Mangqwengqwe said: “We can confirm that there was an overpayment of salary to an ordinary councillor. The matter is being investigated. We can also assure the public that the money will be recovered. We will not divulge any further details as the matter is internal in nature.” Oudtshoorn has been in the news recently with mayor Colan Sylvester facing a party disciplinary hearing into 11 charges of alleged maladministration. There has also been the problem of divisions between Sylvester and Paulse, with public spats over the awarding of tenders. Earlier this year, the mayor threatened to have the municipal manager suspended and in August Sylvester found himself placed on special leave and barred from all party and official duties. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
