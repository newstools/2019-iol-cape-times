The 66-year-old, represented by a private lawyer, made his first appearance on a charge of sexual assault. The State indicated it would be adding more charges and finalising charges against him before his next court appearance, for a bail application, on January 29. The man is set to have 10 more charges, which will be described as Schedule 6 offences, added to his charge sheet relating to sexual assault and rape. The State has also indicated that it would oppose bail. Protesters from Ottery and Grassy Park gathered outside court with placards opposing bail, saying the man posed a threat to the community. Community activist Melanie Arendse said the man had allegedly picked up a number of boys in the area and then he would request them to perform “indecent acts”. “The perpetrator has picked up many of our children. We have (about) 30 children who have been abused by the perpetrator,” she said. Arendse said the man allegedly took the victims to at least three different areas where he would abuse them. “All or most of the victims are from primary schools. He has paid our children to do indecent acts with him. We do not want this in our community and we do not want him to get bail.”
