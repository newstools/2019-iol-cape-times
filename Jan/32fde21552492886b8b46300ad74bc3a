Cape Town – Nine-year-old Linathi Titshala disappeared a month ago, just two days after her birthday. Also called Nomnqindi, she was last seen on the morning of December 16 in Cork Tree Street, Thubelitsha. But she never arrived at her grandmother's house – only three doors away. Delft Community Policing Forum chairperson Charles George told ewn.co.za the search remains ongoing. "Unfortunately, we still have no concrete leads and we still want to go ahead with more extensive searches. We also want to thank the mayor and the city (of Cape Town)] for their  support as well in this whole initiative." Provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed they were still looking for the child. "There is nothing. Nobody knows anything, nobody saw anything, no one has any information about whether she left the house of her own will or was taken," Western Cape Missing Person's Unit chairperson Candice Sobotker told News24.com. Sobotker, who started the unit in 2017 after the death of 3-year-old Courtney Pieters, said Linathi's grandmother discovered she was missing in the afternoon and her disappearance was reported in the evening. Her unit only found out at noon the following day. "The (critical) 24-hour period had passed. From that day we searched right through the entire holidays," she said. Anyone with information is urged to contact the investigating officer, detective Constable Nomabandla Kolweni, on 084 498 0696 or Delft police on 021 954 9000.
