Cape Town – The family of a slain vegetable hawker from Manenberg are offering a R50 000 reward for information to help bring his killers to book. After more than two years with no arrest for the murder of Aubrey “Balla” Anthony, 54, his family say they are desperate for answers. Aubrey was shot during a suspected armed robbery on 5 July, 2016, but cops say the case has gone cold as no information was provided about the attackers. At the time, police explained Aubrey and his co-worker were attacked in Tambo Village when two men tried to stop his vehicle and fired several shots at them. Aubrey was hit in the chest and managed to drive to Manenberg SAPS but later died at hospital, while his co-worker survived. A 36-year-old relative, who asked not to be named, says Aubrey was their rock. “The case was transferred to three detectives and while we understand the constraints of police, we are still looking for answers. “Balla ran the family business and was very popular in Manenberg. At the time that he was killed, he was not married but had four children and two grandchildren.” She says detectives have told the family while some leads were provided, the information was not enough to warrant an arrest. “We are not rich people but we are scraping the money together for Balla and to help the police. The R50 000 will be paid to the person who provides information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the killers.” Manenberg SAPS commander Brigadier Enolium Joseph confirms there has been no arrest. Anyone with information is asked to call the investigating officer on 082 499 4433.
