The municipality had reached an agreement with community representatives of the township in May last year, following protests over an alleged lack of progress by the municipality in the provision of housing for low-income households and backyard dwellers. In terms of the agreement, two portions of land within the urban edge of Masakhane were to be made available for temporary structures, each no larger than 30m², and one communal toilet for every five plots and one communal tap for every 20 plots would be provided. Community leaders would provide a list of the most vulnerable backyard dwellers to the municipality, which would be verified against the municipality’s housing database. Masakhane community leader Thembile Gwele said residents were caught by surprise when the structures were demolished on January 9. “The Red Ants and law enforcement came without a court order, demolishing the structures and damaging the furniture of the residents. "Many were at work, with some not yet back from holidays in the Eastern Cape. Our people have now had to ask other community members to house them.” Gwele said 150 stands agreed on with the municipality were fewer than required by community members. Municipality spokesperson Riana Steenekamp said the structures that were removed were unoccupied and erected without permission. “These structures were not built in the area demarcated for the 150 stands for emergency housing in Gansbaai as agreed. "Members of the affected community met councillors, officials and police to clarify issues and the crowd dispersed peacefully after they received feedback from the meeting.”
