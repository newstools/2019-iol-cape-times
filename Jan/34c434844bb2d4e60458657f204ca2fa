Cape Town – The enOrmus Bud Bio-Active Cell Food is described as an exceptional formulation to feed the microbes that symbiotically enhance plant growth, which increases the yield and quality of home-grown plants. Last week, the Starke Ayres Garden Centre Cape Town launched the enOrmus Bud starter kits, produced by local company TransfOrmus, for novice dagga growers. Richard Morris, garden centre manager at Starke Ayres in Rosebank, described the response to the first dagga growing kit on the local market as "absolutely phenomenal", News24 reported. But the dagga seeds aren't included because despite the changing legislation, it's still illegal to sell them. Since last September, South Africans are allowed to grow dagga in their backyard and smoke it for personal use. "I mean, 25 000 hits literally within two days – we were off the charts. We had three people engaging with customers telephonically - it’s been absolutely crazy," said Morris, who added that the kits made cultivating cannabis much more accessible. "The kit is really a brainwave and a pioneering product in allowing people who are non-gardeners – who couldn’t grow a rose at home – to actually buy everything they need in a single item and actually growing it successfully up to a vegetative stage. "It's now not this hidden underground network all the time – and that's generally the feedback we're getting. It's been empowering and uplifting – I mean most of our client base that are visiting or calling us is in the 50-60 category, which is hilarious." The kit includes starter soil in small pots for the germination process. The biodegradable pots are then transferred into larger pots for the next stage. The kits include the enOrmus bud microbial food for soil and a brochure with instructions for the novice grower.
