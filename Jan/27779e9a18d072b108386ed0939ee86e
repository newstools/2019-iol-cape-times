The devastating fire has left about 200 people homeless heading into the new year after it spread along the mountains to homes at about 5pm on Sunday. Cape Town Disaster Management deputy head Wilfred Solomons-Johannes said: “The blaze that rapidly swept through to Wupperthal Moravian Mission Station also destroyed the clinic, town hall and parsonage of the minister (priest). “The emergency care personnel and ambulances from the (provincial) Department of Health assisted the fire victims throughout the night and have been placed on standby to assist where required.” President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was saddened by the devastation at the small town of Wupperthal, near Clanwilliam. “The nation’s thoughts go out to the people of Wupperthal who have suffered terrible personal losses alongside cultural assets that are of importance to all South Africans and especially Moravian congregations across the Western Cape.” Ramaphosa said local government and the Department of Arts and Culture would work with the Wupperthal community to bring relief to the area. Solomons-Johannes said it was difficult to maintain contact and to reach people at Wupperthal because the telecommunications infrastructure had been destroyed completely, and communications through emergency services were relied upon. Since the blaze, the community has held two emergency meetings with the West Coast District Municipality and the Fire and Disaster Management Services, with the Moravian Church. “The (provincial) Department of Health Services has been requested to assist with the dispensing of medication especially for the aged and frail care, as many of the people living in the Wupperthal town are old,” Solomons-Johannes said. The SA Social Security Agency and the SA Red Cross Society will assist with relief aid and provision of clothes, tents, food and other essential needs.
