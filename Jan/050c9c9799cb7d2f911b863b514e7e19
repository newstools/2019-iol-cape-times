Cape Town – Advocating progressive transformation in education in the Western Cape, the newly formed education alliance made up of the SA Democratic Teachers Union and other unions have vowed to work with teachers and pupils to ensure better quality education. The alliance said the downward spiral in performance in the past matric exams was worrying while teachers devoted countless hours to preparing pupils. “These systemic challenges are aggregated by overcrowding, huge learner-to-educator ratios, lack of schools and infrastructure in working-class areas, while the province is obsessed with testing, evaluation authorities, inspection and the selling of alcohol at schools,” it said. The alliance, which met yesterday, said it would be working closely with staff and pupils to ensure a better matric pass rate and transformation in education in the province. The Western Cape matric pass rate was down from 84.4% in 2017 to 81.5% for the Class of 2018. The province clinched third place again, with the Free State in second with an 87.5% pass rate, an improvement of 1.4% from 2017. Gauteng was named as the top-performing province with a pass rate of 87.9%, an improvement of 2.8% on the previous year’s results.
