The two were doing rigorous training on Sunday for upcoming cycling events when the driver of a blue Toyota Corolla allegedly recklessly drove towards them. Jacobs said Du Raan hit a pothole and, as he rode over to check on him, the driver honked as the road had no shoulder to ride on, and the car narrowly missed him. “We both raised our hands and yelled in shock. He stopped and moved, stopped and moved. "I took (out) my phone and recorded this when he made a sudden U-turn and went for Jandre with his car. The driver of the vehicle almost hit another vehicle before pulling over and grabbed a stick-like object from bushes before attacking Jandre,” he said. Jacobs said a scuffle broke out between the two. “The next thing I saw was another vehicle and two more men picking up rocks and attacking Jandre. I feel so disgusted with myself as I was still frozen at this point. "Another person joined the fray and two women were yelling ‘los hom’ (leave him). I thought it was a robbery and then Jandre was struck on his head with a rock. "His helmet took most of the force but there was still damage to his head,” said Jacobs. He said the driver of the blue Toyota then came at him, hit him over the back with the stick and took his phone. The phone was returned to him. Both were treated at hospital following the traumatic experience. Du Raan suffered severe head injuries and Jacobs sustained deep tissue scars on his back. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of reckless and negligent driving and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm had been opened for investigation. There have been no arrests.
