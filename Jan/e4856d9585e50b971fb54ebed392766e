The first such event took place in October last year, where 65 people joined 10 dogs for the yoga class. Unfortunately, no dogs were adopted, but just under R6 000 was raised, said the clinic fund-raising and communications manager Marcelle du Plessis. “Our small stray unit is packed to the brim. Being an animal hospital, our focus is medical treatment for pets of the Khayelitsha community. We do not, however, turn pets away and have found ourselves with a stray unit that is currently filled over capacity. We had numerous pets handed over to us during the festive season, some even tied to our gates or thrown over the walls at night,” Du Plessis said. The class will be led by local yoga instructor Lee-Ann Elliott and will be guided by Tombstone Pete’s live acoustic music. “Many people are too scared to visit our organisation as we are based in Khayelitsha. This makes it more difficult for us to find homes for pets. We always encourage people to visit as the experience of driving through the diverse and creative community is one everyone should experience. It also opens one’s eyes to the struggles in Cape Town for both humans and pets,” she said. The class will start at 10.30am and the public are advised to be there at 10am to register, get a good spot and spend some time with the dogs. “Bring a yoga mat or towel and invite everyone who is in the market for a new furry friend. The cost of the class is donation-based and all funds raised will go to the Mdzananda Animal Clinic,” Du Plessis said.
