The confiscation of alcohol is one of the most crucial elements in the City’s annual festive season operational plan because of the link between consumption, anti-social behaviour and compromised safety, said Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith. “In Cape Town, alcohol is listed as the second leading cause of drowning incidents. “These are among the reasons our Law Enforcement Department, supported by its Metro Police counterparts, place such heavy emphasis on alcohol confiscations, Smith said. “It is for these same reasons that the City conducts a sustained awareness and education campaign to highlight the dangers of alcohol to road users, beachgoers and the public in general,” he said.
