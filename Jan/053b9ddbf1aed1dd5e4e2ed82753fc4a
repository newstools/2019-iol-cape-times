The disposal of thousands of rands worth of booze at the police central ­liquor storage facility in Belhar yesterday morning formed part of monitoring the implementation of Western Cape Safer Season operations. Joined by national police commissioner General Khehla Sithole and provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula, Police Minister Bheki Cele said the confiscation of liquor was at an all-time high this festive season. “The liquor was not only confiscated from raids and searches conducted at illegal liquor outlets, but also at legal liquor outlets that contravened licence conditions like operating at times they shouldn’t be, throughout the Western Cape. “We are expecting more alcohol to be confiscated and brought to the warehouses tonight because celebrations are continuing,” Cele said. He said alcohol was destroying many lives, and that more needed to be done to regulate its consumption. “Most of the stations that have high quantities of confiscated alcohol are the same stations that (report) a high incidence of murder and attempted murder, sexual assault and rape. "Experience has taught us that alcohol and substance abuse are the main generators of serious and violent crime in this province. “The police have observed under-age children frequenting shebeens and other illegal outlets. Many of them have ended up also becoming victims of crime,” Cele said. He added that the police would investigate the possibility of selling the confiscated alcohol in future so that the money generated could be used where it’s needed most - fighting crime. An inspection was also conducted of the police forces deployed during the holiday period and those who will be part of upcoming crime crackdown operation, Quiet Storm. Cele also went to a roadblock in the Blue Downs Cluster, where the police were hard at work, and conducted a walk-about at Bellville taxi rank were he talked to commuters about safety.
