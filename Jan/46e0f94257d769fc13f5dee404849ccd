Taking place on February 3, the event attracts competitive athletes and beginner swim runners - including a 14-year-old girl and her father competing in the event. And the women are leading the pack as entries received so far for Torpedo SwimRun Val de Vie are 54% women. Swimrun is a relatively new sport that originated in Sweden, and offers off-road and open-water adventure along coastal and inland waterways, with routes designed around the natural environment and with distances varying from race to race. The Torpedo SwimRun Series comprises three events, with the other two being Torpedo SwimRun Cape (on the Atlantic coastline) and Torpedo SwimRun Wild (in the Wilderness area on the Garden Route). Richard McMartin, co-founder of Torpedo SwimRun, said they were excited to see “so many newcomers joining SwimRun”. “This race is much more accessible to new participants and is a solo event rather than a paired one. The swimming is in dams with the longest swim being 400m, and it is not as technical as Cape and Wild. "We are also able to cater for a larger number of athletes. The longest run is 3km. With 2km of swimming in total, and 8km of total running, the whole race is 10km,” McMartin said. Matt Trautman, who will defend his Ironman 70.3 South Africa title this Sunday, will join the team from Red Bull at Torpedo SwimRun Val de Vie. It will be Trautman’s introduction to Swimrun, so he is a wildcard among the returning Torpedo podium athletes. In the women’s race, the 2018 Cape champs, Alex Quenet and Vicky van de Merwe, start as favourites, this time facing off against each other in this solo race.
