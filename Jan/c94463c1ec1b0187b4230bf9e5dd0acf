However, the Students Command hit back, saying it rejected reactionary actions from the military. This after Zanokuhle Mayaphi was seen wearing a camouflage shirt in a television interview earlier this week. In a statement, the defence force said: “The SANDF reiterates that wearing the SANDF uniform when you are not a SANDF member is a punishable offence and anyone who is caught committing this illegal act will be prosecuted.” In a statement, the Students Command said: “The EFFSC UWC notes the unscrupulous determinant of the branch secretary, by the military police without providing any solid reasons” (stet). They said that Mayapi was under duress after he was taken to a military base and “concerned about the unclear and dissatisfactory reasons for him to be taken”. “We reject such reactionary actions coming from the military. We want to unequivocally put it on record that the EFFSC will not be diverted by anybody from advocating for the desperate and needy students at this juncture, the Sizofunda Ngenkani campaign will continue.” The Sizofunda Ngenkani Campaign is calling for fee-free registration at universities.
