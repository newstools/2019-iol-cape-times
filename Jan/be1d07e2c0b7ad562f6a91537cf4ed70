Galela, who taught himself how to dance and founded United Township Dancers, played a significant role in making sure that children - most of whom are his protégés from underprivileged backgrounds in and around Khayelitsha - put their best foot forward. “As a dance teacher, I use dance to work on the kids’ self-esteem, and Pop Up Party has been a great confidence boost for these kids. “Dance is a powerful tool for kids to discover themselves and it is awesome to see them come alive on the dance floor doing what they love best.” The second season of the Pop Up Party will feature 16 talented children from across Cape Town, in areas such as Khayelitsha, Milnerton and Fish Hoek, going head-to-head and expressing themselves through dance. In each episode, children take part in a random music challenge - which sees them coming up with a dance to a randomly selected piece of specially composed local music which they have never heard before, chosen by the DJ. This season’s line-up will follow the success of the first season, also hosted in Cape Town. Programming director and head of children’s content for Africa, Ariane Suveg, said audiences could expect to be captivated by Galela and his young dancers. “The launch of Pop Up Party 2 as our latest African production will be a huge Cartoon Network summer event, with fresh content spread on air and on all our digital platforms. ‘‘The show is essentially about creating spontaneous moments of fun and creativity through music and dance. ‘‘We have seen amazing energy and talent this season and are so excited to share this explosive live party with our Cartoon Network audience.” Catch Galela and the dancers on weekdays at 3.40pm on Cartoon Network.
