Cape Town – The decomposing body of an alleged former Americans gangster has been found by cops buried in a shallow grave on a sports field. Police from the Crime Intelligence Unit were following tip-offs when they discovered the remains of Elton “Bolo” Cilliers, 35, which were covered with tree branches on Wednesday evening at the Portland Sports Field in Hazeldene Road, Mitchells Plain. It’s understood a retired Americans gang boss was called to the crime scene to assist in identifying Cilliers, who was topless but wore trousers. Sources reveal Cilliers had formerly lived at the man’s home in Rocklands, but left and had been living on the street for the last few months. Empty potato bags and other refuse was found around the body. Cops believe the man had been stabbed to death, but a post-mortem will reveal the cause of death. Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk confirmed that the body had been identified. “Mitchells Plain police members received a complaint of a body lying in a shallow grave on an open field next to Hazeldene Road, Portland. “Upon the members’ arrival on the scene, they found a partially decomposed body of a 35-year-old man lying ina shallow grave. “A murder case has been opened for investigation.
