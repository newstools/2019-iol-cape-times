 #imnotashamed to let the world know that at some point in life I was living in the streets with my 1 year old son after my grandmother kicked me out because I had gotten pregnant whe she was looking after me & taking care of my education. It was tough but I knew it wasn't my end pic.twitter.com/FebvuDZbum   #imnotashamed that after 2 years in the streets with my son I decided to go back to finish my high school but I had no money. I did my matric whilst I was doing domestic chores to 4 different houses during the week & weekend in order to pay for fees, buy uniform, food etc 💘 pic.twitter.com/UcnevJ1CaU   #imnotashamed that after being kicked out from home because of early pregnancy while living in the streets I was eating from the bins and also collecting food for my son in the same bins.Whilst it was gloomy and difficult I knew that the future ahead for us was bright 💕✊🏾 pic.twitter.com/PPCTRKA1dA   #imnotashamed that I once worked as a secretary to a Councillor at a municipality who denied me to go on maternity leave.I gave birth to my daughter on Saturday, Monday I was at work, couldn't walk, endlessly bleeding, she asked me to go make tea, I fell on the steps & collapsed pic.twitter.com/Gcj1hshpw9   #ImNotAshamed of my background.
