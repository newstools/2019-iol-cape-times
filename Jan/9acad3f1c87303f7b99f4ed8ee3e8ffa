Cape Town â€“ The fire that started near the Houwhoek Pass on the N2 near Botriver in the Overberg has crossed over the mountain and is now threatening farms and structures in the area. Overberg fire chief Reinard Geldenhuys says the firefighters are doing all they can to contain the blaze, which is being fanned by winds, the SABC reported. This comes as crews were already wrapping up operations after the fire that started on New Year's Day near Betty's Bay devastated the region. Earlier, aerial support, two firefighting teams, including Cape Nature firefighters, were deployed at the scene. Working on Fire spokesperson Lauren Howard also confirmed that "we have firefighters there", News24 reported. The Overstrand Fire Protection Agency posted on Facebook that the wildfire was burning out of control, but there hasn't been a call yet for evacuations. "Fire services are supported by landowners, Overstrand and lots of aerial resources," said the update. The Overstrand municipality said the N2 was still open for traffic and that provincial traffic officers were on the scene to monitor the road because the smoke was affecting visibility.
