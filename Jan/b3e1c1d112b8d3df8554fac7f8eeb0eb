Taking place between February 22 and 24 at the Green Point Cricket Club, the festival brings South African cricket fans across all skill levels together. It allows entrants to participate in different leagues such as a social league, development league and the much-anticipated VIP corporate cup. There are also two new women’s leagues and the introduction of Fives Futbol. Now in its fourth year, the festival is supporting the #HitPovertyForASix initiative, which runs various cricket coaching clinics in the run-up to the event, providing kids with coaching tips from Donald, Schultz and Pringle. The clinics act as a platform for talent to be identified and pursue a professional career in cricket while meeting and playing with some of the past greats of the game. Thirty young development players, and some rising stars who have been nurtured since the 2018 event, will compete. Sasfin Cape Town’s Sean Young said: “There’s no secret that we have cricket fanatics in South Africa of all ages and genders. It’s a sport which brings us together. "A family weekend, the event will include gourmet food trucks, hospitality tents, local gin, champagne, wine and beer specialists, and some of the best of SA’s bands and music talent such as The Kiffness and reggae legends The Rivertones. “We are proud to be associated with such an event and the impact we can have on the community by partnering with the Hit Poverty for a Six initiative.” The festival has grown from around 40 teams in 2016 to just over 100 this year, attracting players from Dubai, Qatar, Durban and Johannesburg.
