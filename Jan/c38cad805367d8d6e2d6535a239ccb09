The market, which took place from December 19 to 23, hosted a variety of exciting offerings which included an amusement park and wellness zone. Compared to the previous year, vendors sold more home-made products and locally produced fashion wear, according to the City. A wider variety of food was also on offer and food trucks participated in a competition where contestants could enjoy a mega-meal on stage. One of the biggest draw-cards was the onstage entertainment. Mayco Member for Urban Management Grant Twigg said the event boosts local trading and attracts tourists to experience the vibrant and diverse culture of Cape Town. Entertainment on stage proved to be a show-stopper with the return of the popular Summer Star singing competition, won by Safwaan Goolam. Goolam walked away with a R10 000 cash price for his performance. The panel of judges in the Summer Star competition included artists Jarrad Rickets, Robin Pieters, Camillo Lombard, Loren Erasmus as well as radio executive Denver Appollis and event organiser Theo Koopman. “The Summer Market accommodated 120 vendors in 150 trading bays. Most vendors reported favourable trading conditions and friendly customers. "This is a great impetus for local trading and, while the Summer Market had a big entertainment value, it should also be seen as a catalyst for economic growth,” Twigg said.
