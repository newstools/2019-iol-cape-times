Cape Town – Liquor transgressions on beaches was the biggest problem the City's Law Enforcement had to contend with over a busy week. As the holidays come to an end, 2 927 units of alcohol were confiscated – more than the previous week's total of 1 716 units – 2 376 fines issued and 11 arrests executed, the City said in a statement. On Monday morning, the City's Marine Unit members arrested a 34-year-old male suspect from Manenberg who had poached 925 periwinkles in the Kalk Bay area. He was taken to the Muizenberg SAPS and charged in terms of the Marine and Living Resources Act. On Sunday, poachers in the Melkbos area left a carrier behind with a stash of abalone at Slabbers Klippe beach at about 2.30am. Marine Unit auxiliary officers, working with the Melkbos Anti Poaching Unit, couldn't prevent a suspect from running away. A total of 259 shucked units of abalone were recovered and booked in at the Melkbos police station. On Saturday, officers on the Grand Parade arrested two suspects, in separate incidents, arrested a 34-year-old for possession of dagga and tika 36-year-old for possession of unga.
