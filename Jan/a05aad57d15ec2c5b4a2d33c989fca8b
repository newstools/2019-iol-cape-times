Cape Town – Just two weeks after becoming a centenarian, beloved “Ma Fienie” died peacefully at home in Montevideo on Sunday. Josephine Marala, who hailed from the West Coast settlement of Goedverwacht, had been bedridden for the past four months. On January 14, family hosted a humble birthday celebration for Marala, and relatives and friends from near and far dropped by to share well wishes for their beloved Ma Fienie, also known as Ma Lesch. Her daughter, Rosie, said: “On Sunday morning just after 4am, the time we usually wake up to see to my mommy, my sister went to the room to check on her. "The night before my mom had an upset tummy, so when we checked on her in the morning, she had already passed on peacefully. We are very sad and will definitely miss her.” Ma Fienie moved to Cape Town at the age of 24 when she met her husband. “She came to Cape Town to look for work so she could help with the family finances and make a contribution to the household. “She is the only surviving sibling of nine. My mother gave birth to 10 children - seven boys and three girls. She also outlived her husband. “My dad died about 20 years ago,” Rosie said. Marala found a job as a carer to a family and reared their two children. Thereafter, she worked at the Cape Town Medical School and this is where the family also grew a big love for the medical field. Ma Fienie, who possessed a zest for life and was dedicated to her career, worked until the age of 75. Cape Times
