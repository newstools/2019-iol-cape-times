Cape Town – A 38-year-old foreign national has been arrested in the CBD for allegedly selling prescribed drugs. Police said on Thursday members of the Narcotics Unit conducted an undercover operation in Strand Street after receiving a tip-off. Spokesperson FC van Wyk told the SABC an undercover agent purchased an abortion tablet for R1 000, leading to the suspect's arrest. He said they seized 260 abortion tablets and 175 Adco tablets worth about R270 000. Van Wyk said the suspect will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court tomorrow on charges under the Medicine Control Act. Meanwhile, the man accused of the murder of retired Irish aid worker John Curran in his apartment in the CBD could not apply for bail in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Wednesday because an interpreter was not available. Curran was stabbed to death in an upmarket security complex building opposite the provincial offices of the National Prosecuting Authority last November. The bail hearing of Mitspa Onyoka, who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was set for March 12.
