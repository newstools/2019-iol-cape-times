Marala, endearingly known as Ma Fienie, had a stream of visitors coming over the threshold at her home in Montevideo. Hailing from the West Coast settlement of Goedverwacht, Marala has been bedridden for the past four months, but this did not deter loved ones who were keen to celebrate Ma Fienie's life with a prayer meeting and small party. Marala’s daughter Rosie said her mother moved to Cape Town at the age of 24 when she met her husband. “She came to Cape Town to look for work so she could help with the family finances and make a contribution to the household. "She is the only surviving sibling of nine. My mother birthed 10 children - seven boys and three girls - from her and my father's marriage, who she also outlived. My dad died about 20 years ago,” Rosie said. Marala found a job as a carer to a family and reared their two children. “Mel and Sylvia Goot, who are now adults, still often visit Ma Fienie and send her gifts. Mel was here (yesterday morning) and got emotional to be able to share in the celebration of Ma Fienie’s birthday. "It was truly a special occasion as we had a prayer meeting done by our Moravian church reverend." Asked what her mother’s secret to life was, Rosie said: “Fruit, fruit and more fruit. And vegetables.”
