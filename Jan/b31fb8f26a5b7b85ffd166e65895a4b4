Cape Town – The DA has retained Ward 31 in the City of Cape Town following a by-election yesterday and snatched Ward 5 in the Bergriver Municipality on the West Coast from the ANC. The ANC retained Ward 101 in Kraaifontein, which became vacant as a result of the murder of councillor Luyanda Mbhele. The ward was contested by the ANC, DA and EFF. In Ward 5, the DA recorded 943 votes, the ANC 826 and the EFF 292. ANC spokesperson Denis Cruywagen said in a statement he was disappointed the party had to "narrowly" concede Ward 5 to the DA. However, the DA said the Bergriver voters gave it another chance after the previous ANC councillor failed to address their concerns, Netwerk24 reported. "We don't take this victory lightly", said Bonginkosi Madikizela, the DA leader in the Western Cape. In Ward 31, while the DA won 2 427 of the votes compared to the ANC's 531, it lost 20% of the vote it had garnered in the 2016 municipal elections. The ACDP recorded 807 votes and the EFF 119. The ward became vacant after the resignation of ward councillor Jonathan Cupido. Ward 101 in Kraaifontein became vacant as a result of the murder of councillor Luyanda Mbhele. The ANC's elections co-ordinator, Ebrahim Rasool, said the Ward 101 result showed that the DA's dream of winning the "African vote" is far from being realised.
