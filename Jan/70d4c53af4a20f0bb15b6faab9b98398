As the new school year began, schools complained about overcrowded classes and violence. Principal of Bergville Primary in Bishop Lavis Aleem Abrahams said that last year from June to August there were 17 people killed in the school’s vicinity. Trauma Centre director Valdi van Reenen-le Roux explained that Bishop Lavis, Manenberg, Hanover Park and Bonteheuwel were among the areas identified by the police as most vulnerable in terms of crime and violence. “This also means that trauma is at its worst in these areas. There is a huge need not just for social workers but counsellors and psychologists at schools in these areas.” Abrahams added: “We had cases where the gangsters ran on to the school grounds. We asked the Western Cape Education Department for a social worker and we will be having a meeting with them about it. We have 450 pupils at the school. “For the school circuit which we fall under there are only five people which include social workers. This circuit includes 22 schools. There are not enough social workers. But the department has said that they will help us with a programme to address the problems.”. In the case of Bergville Primary, department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said: “The district advised the school what support mechanisms they must follow to get psychological support through the wellness programme for educators. Depending on the nature of the incident, learners referred via the school may receive individual counselling/therapy or a group counselling/therapy intervention may be provided.” argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
