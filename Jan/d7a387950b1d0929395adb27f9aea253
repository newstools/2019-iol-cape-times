We also had roadblocks during which 1744 vehicles were stopped, and 775 were tested for alcohol,” Africa said. Traffic officials had arrested 73 drunk drivers, with the highest reading three times over the limit.

Transport Minister Blade Nzimande last week announced the preliminary festive season road safety figures, showing the Western Cape had recorded the third-lowest number of road fatalities between December 1 and January 8. Nzimande said 1286 accidents were recorded in the 2018/19 festive season, resulting in 1612 fatalities. Gauteng and North West were the only two provinces to record decreases in the number of fatalities, while the Northern Cape, Free State and Eastern Cape had recorded the highest-percentage increases.
