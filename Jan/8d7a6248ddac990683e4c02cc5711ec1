Hosted along the Western Cape coastline, the world’s toughest inflatable boat race saw teams racing between Gansbaai and Gordon’s Bay, with a final stage distance of 104km. With 26 teams in four classes racing a total distance of 650.5km over five days, event organisers said they were happy with the number of participants and the spectator turn-out for the 31st staging of this gruelling event. Four teams were disqualified over the course of events. Dagmar Roets, who was the only woman to enter and complete the Challenge, was a co-pilot this year. She completed the race with a torn knee ligament and medial meniscus (an important shock absorber on the inside aspect of the knee joint), and was placed third, together with her husband, Reghard Roets. Organisers had given Dagmar a special award - sportswoman of the race - for her efforts. Infanta Inflatables had first-place positions in the Stock Class, Pro- Stock Class and Modified Class, giving them the overall manufacturers’ award. Racing over the finish line, teams had to put machine and body to the test over a total distance of 650.5km. “There is no other challenge like the Aquila Safari Trans Agulhas,” organisers said.
