Cape Town – The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) has called on residents to help bring to book suspects still at large for the murder of off-duty police officer Melumzi Mlanjana. Mlanjana, 35, was attached to the crime intelligence unit in Bishop Lavis and was shot and killed during an apparent robbery at a spaza shop in Barcelona informal settlement in Gugulethu at around 9pm on Sunday. Police acted swiftly and had managed to arrest two suspects that same day, but their accomplices and the firearm used in the murder are still being sought by investigators. Popcru said Mlanjana was at the shop when unidentified males approached him, and had tried to rob him. “Several shots were fired at close range, hitting him in the face causing fatal injuries. The officer died at the scene. "According to eyewitnesses the officer was at the shop when it seems as if the unidentified males tried robbing the spaza shop. He was caught in the middle of a robbery. “Popcru is calling on the community of Barcelona to report these criminals targeting SAPS or any other law enforcement officers so that they can be successfully prosecuted. "Popcru further condemns this cowardly act and calls all SAPS members to leave everything but hunt these criminals and arrest them within 72 hours,” the union said. Nine 9mm cartridges were found at the scene. “This attack on police officers, whether on duty or off duty, will not be tolerated and no stone will be left unturned in bringing the perpetrators to book,” the union added.
