Cape Town – Police have arrested two suspects, aged 26 and 36, in connection with the murder of an off-duty police officer in Gugulethu. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the 35-year old constable was shot and killed last night during a robbery at a local spaza shop. The arrest was made shortly after the incident, but their accomplices and the firearm used in the murder are still being sought. The chairperson of Parliament’s portfolio committee on police, Francois Beukman, commenting on the murder of a police officer in Koffiefontein, Free State, said last week, TimesLive reported: “It is unacceptable that officers of the law continue to be killed especially while they are on duty and carrying out their duties. “The committee remains of the view that the killing and attack of police officers is a direct attack on the rule of law and the Constitution of the country.” Constable Vuyani March died during a shootout between two feuding farmers on a farm near Koffiefontein on Thursday night. The committee also condemned an attack on police officers in Philippi East, who were responding to information about an illegal firearm in the area. “The SAPS must leave no stone unturned in working to rid our society of criminal elements as well as illegal firearms. "The committee emphasises that the police will only win the war against crime through the direct participation and sharing of information by the community at large,” Beukman said.
