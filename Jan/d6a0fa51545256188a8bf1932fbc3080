The challenge, described as “a unique, life-changing experience”, set sail last month and the team of friends - Cole Barnard, Grant Soll, Lee Gordon and Matt Boynton - were the only South African team to have entered the challenge. They also became the youngest team to complete the sail across the Atlantic in a four-man boat. Mad4Waves took 39 days to finish the race, which they have done in the name of charity. Mad4Waves is currently raising money for recycled plastic school desks and for the Make a Difference (Mad) foundation. The team partnered with the Mad Leadership Foundation, an initiative that provides young, underprivileged people with scholarships, with the objective of sponsoring a promising child through high school and also raising funds to provide desks for 1000 pupils across South Africa. The challenge took 28 teams with 88 rowers from the shores of La Gomera, Canary Islands, across the Atlantic Ocean to the English Harbour in Antigua. TWAC spokesperson Georgia Murray said each participant burns around 8 000 calories a day and loses approximately 20% of their body weight. “Alongside the physical challenge, they have to work together to stay mentally strong as they (spent) Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve away from their families during this transformational adventure, which usually lasts anywhere between 30-90 days. “Through the hardships, they (were) also privy to breathtaking moments, being close to nature, amazing sea life, and beautiful sunsets.” To assist the Mad4Waves crew in their donation drive, visit their crowdfunding campaign on https://www.backabuddy.co.za/champion/project/mad-4-waves-transatlantic-row
