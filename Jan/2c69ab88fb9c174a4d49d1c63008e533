Cape Town – No police report has been submitted following the crash on the N1 at Century City where a married father-of-two ended up having his legs amputated after an alleged illegal street race. On condemning the incident, Mayco Safety and Security member JP Smith said after the crash, which took place just after midnight on Monday, "it is just the latest example of the devastation wrought by illegal street racers on our streets”. Smith said that in Cape Town alone there are more than 20 hot spots where racers take part in these illegal activities. However, police have confirmed to News24 that no docket has been opened for investigation following the accident in which Taufiq Carr, 26, lost control of his BMW M3 near the Sable Road turnoff. In video footage of the incident, the BMW can be seen changing lanes at high speed before ramming into the centre median. According to the police, City of Cape Town authorities had responded to the scene and not the SAPS. This meant that a docket could only be opened once the incident report was submitted by the responding authority. Executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman said the City was "currently looking into the matter" and would liaise with the police to "ensure that all the necessary information is in place to proceed with the investigation". Smith said after the incident the City's traffic services were unable to prosecute motorists on the strength of third-party evidence such as video footage. The Cape Town businessman's mother, Moesna Carr, was quoted as saying after her son's operation: "This is a lesson for him, and for everyone. "We are not asking for people's sympathy, but their prayers. This was put out for us – a test from God. We're just so grateful he is alive."
