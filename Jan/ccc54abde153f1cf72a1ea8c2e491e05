Cape Town – Police hope video footage in their possession will help locate Muizenberg mother Angelique Ripepi, who went missing when she went for a job interview at a shopping centre in Table View. Ripepi was last seen by a friend who had dropped her off at the mall on Saturday. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the 25-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday. “According to reports, Angelique left her residence in Dune Crescent, Muizenberg Saturday at approximately 7.30am and was dropped off by a friend, at a mall in Table View. "On leaving her residence, she was dressed in a white and blue floral top, black tights and brown takkies. Muizenberg SAPS are investigating the incident,” said Van Wyk. Ripepi’s family said community search parties, the Pink Ladies and other organisations, including an anti-human trafficking group, have been assisting. “We are urging people not to spread false rumours. Angelique has not been found or made contact with anyone in the family. She is a responsible young lady who would inform her family and her friends about her whereabouts. "We are worried and hopeful she will be found soon because her six-year-old daughter has started to ask questions we don’t have answers to. "We are calling on anyone who saw something or heard something to inform the police,” said her father, Anthony Matthee. Table View Community Police Forum chairperson David Harris said 90% of the community had been made aware of the search and encouraged community groups to continue spreading the word.
