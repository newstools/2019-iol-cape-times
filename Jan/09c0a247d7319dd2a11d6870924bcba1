She achieved six distinctions and a “B” despite her humble circumstances. But the 17-year-old faces another hurdle of paying university fees having already struggled to raise the R25 000 for registration. Her goal is to become an astrophysicist and her heart is set on studying at the University of Cape Town. Malissa said yesterday that her goal has never been to be the top achiever in her grades but rather to do her best. “I am blessed because I have a mother who supports and encourages me,” she said. Her mom Elmarie Julius said during the bus strike last year, she travelled with her daughter to school to ensure she got there safe. “I have never had to do much to motivate my daughters to study but I appreciate their hard work because I had to leave school early to help my mother.” Julius said she chose to send her daughter to Alexander because of its history, having read that former president Nelson Mandela visited the school after his release from prison. Julius said they had applied to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and were awaiting feedback. Principal Adela Domingo said: “We do our best to assist all our learners, who are predominantly from poorer backgrounds but we do the best with the bare minimum. ‘‘I think the exam results level the playing the field. We are open to people coming forward to assist the school so we may help our learners to achieve a great future, ” Domingo added. Deputy principal Fazilet Bell said the school was wrongly categorised as a quintile 5 school and therefore the achievements of learners such as Malissa may not stand out compared to former Model C schools. Anyone wanting to assist Malissa should call the school on 0216971350 or email faziletbell@gmail.com
