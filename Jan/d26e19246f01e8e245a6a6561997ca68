Cape Town – Voting is proceeding well in three areas of the Western Cape holding by-elections today, says the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). Several political parties are contesting two wards in the City of Cape Town and one in the Bergriver municipality on the West Coast. IEC provincial head Courtney Sampson said voting stations opened at 7am and they will remain open until 9pm, after which vote counting will start, the SABC reported. Ward 101, Ward 31 and Ward 5 is being contested by 12 candidates from various parties and one independent candidate. The parties include the DA, the ANC, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and the EFF. Ward 31 in Bonteheuwel was previously represented by the DA and became vacant as a result of the councillor’s resignation.
