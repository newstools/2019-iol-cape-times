The driver had apparently transported two passengers from Plumstead to Grassy Park in Zeekoevlei on Saturday night. From there, the driver was directed to a dead-end. The two passengers allegedly threatened him with knives and told him to get out of the ­vehicle. They fled with his car, wallet that contained R310 and his cellphone.
