Cape Town – A family is desperate to find a mother of two from Delft who vanished nearly a month ago. They say Judy Isaacs, 32, of Roosendal was last seen by her family on 15 December. Her father, Leonard Isaacs, says Judy left the Delft area with her boyfriend and has been missing since. “We have reported the matter to the police,” explains Leonard. Judy, who the family reveals is a drug addict, has two children, aged two and four. “She has been on tik for two years,” says Leonard. “We are just very worried because we have not seen her since that day." If you have seen her, contact the family on 084 426 5828 or 021 448 9500. As thousands of parents ooze excitement with their children preparing to go back to school, a Delft family has issued a desperate plea for anyone with information about their missing nine-year-old daughter to come forward. Meanwhile, Linathi Titshala, also known as Nomnqindi, who has been missing for more than three weeks, missed her first day in Grade 4 at Delft South Primary this week. She was last seen on December 16, two days after her birthday. Linathi was wearing black skinny jeans, a grey top with laces at the back and black slippers. At the time, she was walking to her mother’s home from her grandmother’s house in Cork Tree Street, Thubelitsha. The two houses are only three doors away from each other. Linathi’s mother Siphokazi said she was constantly praying for the girl’s safe return. Daily Voice/Cape Times
