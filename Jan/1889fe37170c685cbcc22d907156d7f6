In a packed main hall, deputy president of the Student Representative Council Songezo Booi told the first-year students and their parents that access to a university was often a challenge because of limited space. UWC received about 40 000 first-year undergraduate applications for 2019 from around the country. “You are very fortunate to be here, so use this opportunity to the best of your ability. As Robert Sobukwe said: ‘Education is a means to be of service to Africa - this journey won't be an easy one, but persistence and perseverance is what will get you through’,” Booi said. UWC chairperson of Council Yasmin Forbes reminded students that their journey of excitement and change had just started. “Let us strive to complete the journey. The skills you acquire here are the skills that will have an impact on society and the world.” Professor Pamela Dube, deputy vice-chancellor: student development and support, told students that education was the pathway to change. “Historically, UWC has welcomed many who were the first in their families to attend a university - let me tell you that in just four years you can change your life and the lives of your family members.” First-year student Diego Vries from Milnerton always had ambitions of studying BCom finance at UWC. “With business I think that my chances are greater for finding employment in various fields.” Cape Times
