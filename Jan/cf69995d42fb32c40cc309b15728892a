The children, ranging from grades R to 11, have since last week been waking up early and dressing neatly in their uniforms - to be taught in a empty facility previously used as a clinic, a Methodist church hall, and other school and community halls. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) has identified Mfuleni, 40km outside Cape Town, as one of the worst for overcrowding. Community leader and parent Sipho Delana said 20% of the learners migrated from Eastern Cape while the majority came from other communities within the province during land grabs. “These are all new pupils that applied as early as March (last year) but we have very few schools here and they are all full. “We maybe have 10 operational schools, of which three are temporals while the population of people residing in the area is ridiculously more. “Two more temporal schools will be introduced but there are still disputes regarding that. The two prefab institutions are in Silversands, about 5km from us meaning they are not Mfuleni schools. We want the schools relocated to Mfuleni,” Delana said. Tsitsa Primary School hall is accommodating foundation phase with close to 1 000 pupils, according to parents. The school also helps feed the children. Parents say the church accommodates a Grade 9 class while the clinic building has the Grade 8s and the community hall takes Grade 10 class. WCED spokesperson Jessica Shelver said the situation in Mfuleni was being attended to as a priority by their district and infrastructure officials.
