Cape Town – A Delft couple is mourning the loss of their 5-year-old daughter who was hit by a speeding car on Robert Sobukwe Drive. The heartbroken family of Thembakazi Matoto, 5, say the young girl was sent flying into the air, landing head first and dying on impact on Sunday. It is alleged a speeding driver had jumped a red robot and hit the child as the family was crossing the road. Father, Ben, 49, says shortly before 1 pm, the family was walking home after attending church in Uitsig. He says along, with his wife, Eunice, and son, Khosikhona, 12, they crossed the road near the intersection of 35th Avenue when a silver Toyota Corolla came speeding on. “Khosikhona was holding her hand and he just got on the kerb when the car came,” Ben says. “It was a driver in a Corolla who jumped the robot and I just saw her fly through the air. He hit her very hard and I ran to her, but she was already dead. The grieving father says as he attended to the little girl, the driver had tried to drive off, but women in Malawi Camp who witnessed the incident blocked him and called the police. Ben says as paramedics declared Thembakazi dead, angry residents wanted to hit the driver. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk confirmed the incident and says a culpable homicide case has been opened. “No arrest has been made as yet. The investigation continues,” he says. However, the family visited Ravensmead Police Station, where they were informed that the driver has been charged. “The police took him away because the community was very angry and wanted to hit him,” says Ben. “We went to the police and the detective told us he has been charged. We are heartbroken by Thembakazi’s death. “We are still in shock because that driver was going so fast and the robot was red.” monique.duval@inl.co.za
