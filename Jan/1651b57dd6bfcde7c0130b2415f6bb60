Kite Beach in Blouberg played host to this year's star-studded event. Riders will have to master both the wind and the ocean in an attempt to rule the skies. The event window period started on Saturday and runs until February 10, to ensure the 18 participants have the perfect conditions for big-air kite surfing and will run on the windiest day within the window period. This year the competition plays host to a stock of past champions, including Jesse Richman (US), Aaron Hadlow (UK), Nick Jacobsen (Denmark) and defending 2018 champion Kevin Langree (Netherlands). In addition, fans can expect a stellar field that includes Liam Whaley (Spain) and Lewis Crathern (UK) who finished on the podium in 2018. There's also some local talent to support with Red Bull Megaloop 2017 winner Josh Emanuel and Ross Dillon Player. With familiar faces to the competition Ruben Lenten and Jerrie van de Kop returning and GKA Kiteboarding “Air Games” world champion Carlos Mario making his debut at the event, young and old have been encouraged to show the riders some love by going down to the beach. The famous Cape Doctor gale-force winds have been much anticipated and event organisers started the countdown to what is pipped as the pinnacle big air event on the annual kite surfing calendar.
