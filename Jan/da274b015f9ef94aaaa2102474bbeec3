Cape Town – A 17-year-old boy from Hanover Park was stabbed to death in the early hours of Monday morning after apparently being chased down by a group of men. According to witnesses, the boy was chased for a while before he was caught by his attackers and dragged into their car. The witness said the car did not drive away, and people inside the vehicle were shouting at the boy. Nobody could identify the make or model of the car. The teen was stabbed multiple times and dumped in Philans Walk, where he died from his injuries. Residents of Hanover Park said the boy was well-known and not a gangster and they did not know why he was killed. “But the men who chased him were definitely gangsters and they came to kill him,” one scared resident said. “They threw him out of the car. I heard screaming and people running and a car driving away. “Soon after the police vehicles came and we saw that the boy was dead. He was stabbed a lot and we knew he would be dead,” the resident told the Daily Voice. Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said the matter was under investigation by police. “The circumstances surrounding a stabbing incident in the early hours of Monday morning are being investigated by Philippi police. “A 17-year-old man was stabbed to death about 1.45am at Philans Walk, Hanover Park. A murder case was registered for investigation.”
