The 25-year-old was reported missing on Sunday after leaving her residence in Dune Crescent, Muizenberg, for a job interview at a shopping centre in Table View. She was last seen by her friend who had dropped her off at the mall on Saturday. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the circumstances leading to her disappearance were under investigation. A number of search parties, including safe community parties, the Pink Ladies and other organisations assisted in the search. Her emotional mother Dawn Matthee said the family was relieved she was found alive. “Many people (have gone) missing and have never been found and others were found dead. We are really grateful to the woman who saw her. “I now know the pain of not knowing where your child is or what she is eating. Those parents still waiting for their children to come home must not give up. “We also appreciate the love and support that we have received from the public and the police. “We ask that the family is given space to heal and cope with this matter, especially Angelique, as she has been through a lot.”
