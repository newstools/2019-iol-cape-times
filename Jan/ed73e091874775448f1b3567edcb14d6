Among those were a 10-year-old passenger in Nuweberg/Grabouw, a passenger in Porterville, another passenger in Stellenbosch, a pedestrian in Khayelitsha, a passenger in Worcester and a driver in Worcester. A 3-year-old child was among the three people injured when their vehicle rolled and crashed into a tree on Rhodes Drive in Constantia. ER24 paramedics, along with the metro police and other services, arrived on the scene to find the vehicle on the side of the road against a tree. “A woman believed to be in her 20s was found lying outside the vehicle, while a man, also in his twenties, along with a young girl, was trapped inside the car. “Metro rescue services had to use specialised equipment to free the two trapped patients from inside the vehicle. Once freed, paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported them to nearby hospitals for further treatment,” said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring.
