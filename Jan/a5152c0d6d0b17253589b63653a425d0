Cape Town – The country's top achiever in Quintile 2, or no-fee, schools, Kamva Goso, from Intsebenziswano High School in Philippi, plans to study actuarial science at UCT and has encouraged pupils "to always rise above their challenges". And social media believes the sky is the limit for this 18-year-old, who just missed out on being the top performing student in physical science and achieved seven distinctions. "Where you come from is not who you are and what your society does is not a reflection of what you do… Do your own thing as a person – if you want to focus on academics, focus on academics," said Goso, the SABC reported. Athandwe Ndlebe posted on Facebook: "Can someone offer life coaching to this young man. I see that he comes from initiation school, where he became a man. This is a journey that needs a lot of guidance and support." Salegga Petersen posted: "Shows hard work pays... go pick those lovely fruit my boy... you deserve all the praise... all the best for the future."     #Matric2018: Kamva Goso from Phillipi is the top achiever in SA in the 2nd quintile.
