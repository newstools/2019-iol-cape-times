The plant was not adequately maintained, resulting in poor water quality and officials from neighbouring municipalities, including Oudtshoorn, have stepped in to rehabilitate the plant, according to Local Government MEC Anton Bredell. Zoar residents in the Kannaland Municipality, about 30km from ­Calitzdorp, had short-term water challenges at the weekend, Bredell said. “This happens when demand exceeds supply and the reservoirs run dry due to groundwater taking a while to replenish the tanks. "It remains critical that the small towns in the Karoo’s water supply get managed carefully, conscientiously and daily to ensure the reservoirs do not run dry. “We remain in consultation with the Kannaland council. Regarding alleviation, the district municipality has already placed seven water tankers in Zoar,” Bredell said. The Oudtshoorn Municipality said its water supply was also under great pressure due to problems with the pumps at two of the boreholes with the strongest supply. “The Huis River, from where De Rust gets its water, is flowing very poorly and residents are cautioned to use water very sparingly. "Due to the water supply problems on the Little Karoo Rural Water Supply Scheme, the provision cannot currently be supplemented from there to De Rust,” the municipality said.
