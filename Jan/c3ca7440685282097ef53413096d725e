Cape Town – Kraaifontein residents were shocked on finding a 90-year-old woman bleeding and tied up after her home was burgled. Neighbours in Peerless Park East say the grandmother was known for her soft nature and heart of gold. “She helped everyone who came to her door, no matter their circumstances,” said a resident, who asked not to be named. Just after 4pm on Monday, a brazen robber, dressed all in black and carrying a black backpack, attacked the elderly woman in her Hof Street home and robbed her of a large amount of money and jewellery. Neighbours who heard screams went to investigate and found her. “Ouma has a boarder living with her in the house, but during the day she is alone. The skelm had to have known where she hid her monies and her jewellery. He must have been watching her,” says the 40-year old neighbour. “The skelm went straight to the cupboard where she had been storing her jewellery over the years. He knew she kept money under her mattress and also in envelopes elsewhere. “We are extremely grateful that she was not murdered. She was tied up and sustained deep gashes on her hands and arms.” The neighbour says the woman was rushed to hospital for shock and to receive counselling. “She is a woman with a good heart and for this to have happened to her is terrible. We saw that skurk walking past the house. He was wearing dark clothes, with a dark backpack. His face was hidden so no one could recognise him,” she adds. Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk confirmed: “A 90-year-old female was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money and jewellery on Monday at 4.30pm in her home in Hof Street, Kraaifontein. “A case of house robbery was registered for investigation at Kraaifontein SAPS.” Anyone with information regarding the attack is requested to contact Detective Sergeant Kortjie on 021 980 5585.
