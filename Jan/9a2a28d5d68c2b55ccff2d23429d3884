Cape Town – A robbery suspect was caught red-handed in Rondebosch East earlier this afternoon, but a second suspect unfortunately managed to get away. The suspects gained entry by breaking the lock of the garage door and were stealing copper and wires from the premises, the City said. A 50-year-old man was arrested for burglary and theft and detained at Lansdowne police station after the City of Cape Town's Metro Police Property Crime Unit received information regarding a burglary in progress in the Rondebosch East area. In Hanover Park, Metro Police officers confiscated a 9mm pistol and more than a dozen rounds of ammunition today, the City said. "Officers were on patrol in the vicinity of Oribi court at about 1.30pm when they spotted two men walking – one of them carrying a bag. When the duo spotted the officers, the one carrying the bag dropped it to the ground. "Officers soon found out why, because when they searched the bag, they found a Browning pistol with the serial number filed off and 13 rounds of live ammunition. "The suspect, who is 26 years old, was booked in at Philippi SAPS on a charge of the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition."
