Police say in three of the incidents the victims were under the influence. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “One victim came from a staff party with her colleagues when one colleague took advantage of her while they were sleeping. “The second victim was raped by a shebeen owner and the third one came from a shebeen and was raped by her boyfriend’s friend while they were all sleeping together. “The fourth victim was allegedly raped in Browns Farm by the suspect. While she was waiting for her relative, the suspect had pretended to assist the victim to look for her brother but he took her to his residence and allegedly raped her.” Van Wyk said the suspects had been sought since the incidents were reported. “Members of the Nyanga Family, Violence and Child Protection Unit have vowed to bring the perpetrators of crimes against women and children to book.” He said two of the four, aged 25 and 31, will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Friday while the other two, aged 25 and 34, were due to appear in the same court. Nyanga Community Police Forum spokesperson Martin Makasi condemned attacks on women and called for the courts “to do right by the victims”. “We are hoping that the law will not disappoint these victims because we don’t need people like that in our communities. It is absurd that some men prey on and take advantage of women. “More needs to be done in our communities to tackle this issue. “The government needs to seriously pay attention to shebeens as they are illegal entities where some operate 24 hours and this contributes to crime,” he said. “Police do raids and arrest the owners. However, they get out with fines which is not helping at all. “If they can’t close them, then make them operate within the parameters of the law and maybe legalise them,” Makasi said. Cape Times
