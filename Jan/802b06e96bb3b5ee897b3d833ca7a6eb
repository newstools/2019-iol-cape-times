Van Syster, her children and grandchild, spent the first night on the veranda of her home after the sheriff of the court removed all their belongings and the owner had them locked out. “The owner sent letters not long after my husband died in 2017. My husband worked and lived on the farm since he was very young. "The letters were in English and I didn’t understand what they were saying and didn’t want to go to the court as I didn’t want to inconvenience the owner. He said because my daughter and I don’t work for him he was not obligated to give us lodging,” she said. Van Syster, who works as a domestic, said Women on Farm Project had assisted them by getting them temporary accommodation at a former clinic on Friday. Had the Women on Farm Project not intervened, they would have been moved to De Doorns, where the family knows no one. Van Syster said it would have been difficult because her 18-year-old son was enrolled in a skills school. Women on Farm Project case worker Madeleine Herwil said they heard of Van Syster’s plight through their network in the Rawsonville region. They mobilised their members and protested outside the gates of Rustfontein farm. According to Vinpro Rustfontein, owned by Phil du Toit, cultivates the best Pinotage vineyard block in the Worcester and Breedekloof. Several attempts to reach Du Toit were unsuccessful. The Breede Valley Municipality spokesperson Johan Botha said the municipality was aware of the eviction and was planning to engage the Women on Farm Project, but could not comment further on the situation at this time.
