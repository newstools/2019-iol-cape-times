The fire started on a farm alongside the Van der Stel Pass but was exacerbated when a fire that was extinguished above Houw Hoek two weeks earlier flared up again. These two fires merged on Saturday, creating additional challenges for firefighting teams. The fire is still burning, having crossed the N2. The fire brought farmers, local companies and firefighting authorities together in what was a five-day intensive battle to control the blaze. The fire, which has burnt around 11 000 hectares so far, has been fuelled by gale-force winds. Paul Cluver of the Paul Cluver Wine estate said: “This is an example of a community standing together and giving selflessly. "They’ve contributed food, resources and teams of people to help fight the fire, working right through the night. We are so grateful for the support.” Cape Times
