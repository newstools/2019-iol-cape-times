Cape Town – A 47-year-old British man appeared briefly in the Somerset West Magistrate's Court on Wednesday over three incidents in which children were allegedly assaulted – two at the Waterstone Village Mall in Somerset West and one at the Heldervue Spar. The case of Mark Hay, who is facing two counts of assault as well as assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, was postponed to January 23. He has been accused of allegedly stabbing a 5-year-old boy, who only sustained a minor injury, in the chest while he went shopping with his mother at the Waterstone Village Mall on Monday; allegedly assaulting a 10-year-old girl at the Spur at the Waterstone Village Mall around 9.52am on Saturday; and slapping a 10-year-old girl in the face at the Heldervue Spar on Friday. Hay, who interrupted the magistrate on Wednesday when his rights were read to him, was warned to first listen and then to indicate if he needs legal assistance, Netwerk24 reported. His Legal Aid lawyer then explained to him that he was being charged with assault. Hay then enquired whether he would be freed, to which his lawyer responded by saying that he would be remanded in custody as he had not been given bail yet. Hay, who indicated to his lawyer that he is from England, lives in Heldervue, according to the charge sheet. The Heldervue Spar manager reportedly said that Hay is a regular client.
