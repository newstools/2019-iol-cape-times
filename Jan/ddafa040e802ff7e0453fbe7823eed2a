That is according to Ray de Vries, founder and chief executive of the Air Water company, based in Cape Town, that produces them as part of its “zero plastic, zero harm” campaign. Made from sugar cane, the 100% sustainable bottle can be used as many times as necessary and, once composted, decomposes within 120 days, said De Vries. “The Eco Water Bottle will be on the shelves within months. We are talking to investors because we want to export the bottle. There has been a huge amount of interest in South Africa and beyond,” he added. De Vries said he had been so impressed with the bottle that he had marketed the product to other industries as well. Twelve years ago, his company introduced to South Africa machines that made water from air by setting up a humidity bottling plant in Cape Town. “We were very pleased to lead the way in this remarkable new way of producing water for South Africans to drink, but what really bothered me was the plastic we served it in. “We moved to glass bottles with steel caps on a returnable basis and that has gone a long way towards eliminating the plastic scourge, but non-glass bottles are needed around hotel swimming pools, in stadiums and at schools,” said De Vries. “We needed to find something that could replace plastic. I was approached by two South African youngsters who said they had the answer: bottles made from sugar cane. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when they not only presented the bottle to me, but sugar cane glasses, straws and even shopping bags. The bottles are multi-use, non-toxic and 100% environmentally friendly. “I just love it when South Africans come up with innovations like this.”
