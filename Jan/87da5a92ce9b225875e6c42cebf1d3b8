Cape Town – The family of the 6-year-old girl who was injured in a drive-by shooting at Bokmakierie in Athlone wants justice to be served. On Tuesday, Minister Bheki Cele visited Brionay Julies' family after the incident on Saturday evening in which a 35-year-old man was killed and two other men wounded. Cele also visited Brionay, who was wounded in the upper leg, in hospital. Her mother, Gail Julies, said the Grade 1 pupil is in a stable condition at the Red Cross Children's Hospital, ewn.co.za reported. Her father, John Julies, blames himself because he had sent the 6-year-old girl to a nearby shop to buy spices when she got caught in gang crossfire. “I didn’t expect it to happen… I think the moment she came back from the shop running, that’s when the shooting was happening and the bullet hit her.” He thanked God that the bullet struck his daughter's leg instead of an organ. Cele said the police and other departments would double their efforts to normalise the situation in areas affected by gang violence. He promised the family officers won't rest until the gangster who fired the shot is behind bars. “We have identified the man we want (and) we have confiscated the car.”
