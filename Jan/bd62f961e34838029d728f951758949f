The parade is hosted with the support of the Stellenbosch Municipality and sees the participation of some of the country’s most famous wineries, including Kleine Zalze, Clos Malverne, Middelvlei, Kaapzicht, Beyerskloof and L’Avenir. A merry, family-friendly spectacle is promised with local farms taking to the streets accompanied by musicians and a festive entourage for the celebration and blessing of the year’s grape harvest. Stellenbosch Wine Routes manager Elmarie Rabe said: “Stellenbosch is the heartland of South African wine, which gives special significance to the harvest parade. It’s about celebrating the bounty that the harvest brings, but also the spirit of goodwill that prevails despite the season’s physical demands.” The parade sets off from the Van der Stel sports grounds at 9am and leads down Alexander Street to the town hall, where the harvest blessing will take place. From there, it returns along Merriman Avenue to conclude in the delightful Agri-worker Crafts and Family Day. “It’s always a fantastic sight because you get to see and celebrate the real people who take the wine from vine to bottle - the farmworkers. Here is the opportunity to experience a cornerstone of the winemaking story that is often forgotten.” Organiser’s said the public could expect the colourful splash of tractors decorated with grand flair; the lively sounds of trumpets and drums and tambourines, and glittering costumes. The craft expo show officially opens upon conclusion of the parade and takes place in collaboration with the Stellenbosch Agricultural Society at the town hall, from around 10am to 3pm. Entrance is free.
