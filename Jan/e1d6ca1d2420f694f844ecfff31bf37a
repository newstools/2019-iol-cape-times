The suspected thieves were arrested on Friday while they were busy stripping a stolen vehicle in Wellington Road, Bloekombos, Kraaifontein. “After following up on information received from the public, the six suspects were caught in the act of stripping the stolen motor vehicle. “The six suspects aged between 19 and 28 years old were arrested and detained on a charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle at Kraaifontein SAPS,” said police spokesperson FC van Wyk. The vehicle was stolen in Beach Road, Strand, on Thursday. The suspects will appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court. A 52-year-old Mitchells Plain resident is expected to make her first court appearance at the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court today after she was arrested for dealing in drugs. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said police executed a search warrant at the woman’s home in Erica Street, Tafelsig on Friday. “At about 5.10pm, members attached to the Mitchell’s Plain Crime Prevention Unit executed a search warrant at a house in Erica Street after receiving information that drugs were being stored at the house. "During the search the members found 223 mandrax tablets, 42 small packets of tik, and 28 dagga stoppe hidden in a dirt bin inside the kitchen,” Van Wyk said. The drugs had an estimated street value of R12 000. In another incident in Mitchells Plain, members doing a routine crime prevention patrol arrested a man, 37, in front of a known drug house in Melkweg Street, Rocklands. “They found in his possession 10 packets of tik, 10 quarter mandrax tablets, 20 half tablets, three whole tablets,” Van Wyk said.
