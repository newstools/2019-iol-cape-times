Kyle Croy, 18, has been selected for Cape Town’s Ikapa United squad that will play in the annual Dallas Cup International Youth Football Tournament in Dallas, Texas. The Bishop Lavis High School Grade 11 pupil must raise R30 000 to be able to travel with Ikapa’s team on April 9 for the Fifa-sanctioned tournament that will host 180 teams from around the world. His father, Eustace Croy, said: “I would like people to help underprivileged children like Kyle to get funds to go overseas with Ikapa. I appeal to businesses, organisations and people to help towards raising the money needed by Kyle to go overseas.” Croy said he had already raised R3 900 towards his son’s travelling costs through fundraising events he had organised, despite many challenges. “You can’t hold fundraising events in Valhalla Park, because it’s too dangerous. The place is upside down, because of the gang violence,” he said. His colleagues at work and friends were helping to raise money, and they were organising a karaoke event, and other events, at which to raise the balance of R26 000. Ikapa United, which is affiliated to Cape District Football Association, confirmed Kyle’s selection for the overseas trip in a letter appealing for assistance in sponsoring his trip. In the letter, Ikapa’s project co-ordinator Richard Poole said: “Most of the players hail from our disadvantaged areas. We ask you to support our soccer development and to assist Kyle to make the most of this exceptional opportunity to represent his country.” Ikapa United’s banking details for sponsors for Kyle’s trip are: account number 07 229 0315; Standard Bank; Helderberg branch; branch code 03-30-12; reference - Kyle Croy.
