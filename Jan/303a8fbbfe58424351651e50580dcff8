They have warned that they would shut down the town if their pleas for basic services and housing continue to be ignored. The community is set to meet the municipality following a protest on Monday after interim chemical toilets were removed. The executive mayor, Christelle Vosloo, said the Madiba Park situation developed two years ago when a group of people were chased out of Bereaville, Genadendal, and settled on a piece of land on Farm 39 in Greyton. “Farm 39 is Moravian Trust Land of which the Minister of Rural Development, Gugile Nkwinti, is the custodian. After they were chased from Madiba Park too, the municipality took a humanitarian decision to accommodate the homeless people in tents on a piece of municipal land.   “The people later moved back to Madiba Park without consulting the municipality, and statements that the municipality moved the people there are a lie,” she said. Vosloo said access to basic services could not be provided as Nkwinti had custody of the land. The municipality did not have land ready to move the people to and constantly requested the minister to allow the people to remain there as an interim measure. She said the removal of the interim chemical toilets over the weekend was due to a misunderstanding and had been rectified. Nkwinti’s office did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Madiba Park Committee member Colleen Phillip has disputed Vosloo’s version. “Those people are migrant workers and did not come here on their own. We were asked by the municipality to allow them to stay as the cost of renting the tents was too expensive. “Two years ago, promises were made to all of us about housing, and we know there is land, they know it, and we will shut his town down again if they continue with their lies.” Greyton Ward 2 Forum member Derek Crabtree said the council was provided with several solutions to the problem, which it had ignored.
