Cape Town – Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) provincial head Courtney Sampson has hailed the voter registration in the Western Cape at the weekend as a success. Over the two days political parties were out in full force to encourage citizens to register to vote in the much- anticipated general elections in May. Sampson said they set out to give as many eligible voters as possible the opportunity to register by opening their 1 579 voting stations for this purpose. “We wanted to make it as accessible for them to do so and we appear to have achieved that goal. There has been quite a bit of interest even so late in the day.” Sampson said they had 5 000 volunteers working over the weekend and among them were a special couple. “There is an amazing couple, Earl and Melissa Eksteen, who lost their 4-year-old twin sons in a fire last week, but they were working over this weekend and that kind of commitment is just encouraging to all of us.” He said the input of young people was important. “We need the co-operation of young people, their insights - this is the digital age, we need young thoughts. Registration is the first step.” From today citizens will only be able to register at IEC offices. In Mfuleni, two former chairpersons of the ANC in the Western Cape, Ebrahim Rasool and Mcebisi Skwatsha, were among scores of ANC volunteers, office-bearers, Cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, MPs, councillors and members of the provincial legislature who were on the voter registration drive yesterday. On Saturday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane, accompanied by MECs including premier candidate Alan Winde and Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, were in Mitchells Plain. EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee visited a number of wards yesterday, including in Khayelitsha. Cape Times
