The project was hailed by the region’s rugby legends, including Randy Marinus and John (Pompies) Williams. Deputy president of the SA Rugby Union Francois Davids and former president of the Western Province Rugby Union Thelo Wakefield attended the ceremony hosted by the Drakenstein Municipality in April last year. Paarl region Sports Forum chairperson Mario Williams said nothing has been done since the sod-turning except the removal of some trees. “This project had so much potential and had been welcomed by the community, with talks to the various clubs of a museum to honour the many legends of the game,” said Williams. A Drakenstein Municipality spokesperson said in the 2017/2018 financial year project implementation started with the appointment of Esor Construction Pty Ltd for the first phase through a formal tender process. “During August 2018, Esor Construction, however, applied for business rescue and abandoned site on August 15, 2018. “Due to the contractor not responding to any instructions, nor returning to site, the contractor’s contract was terminated on October 4,” she said. She said due to rigid contract conditions put in place, no financial loss was recorded and an existing municipal rates tenderer had been approached to take over the turnkey project and complete the outstanding work.
