Cape Town â€“ A man who allegedly robbed a jogger of his cellphone in Muizenberg this morning was arrested soon after. The incident took place at 6.30am while Law Enforcement officers were on patrol on the Muizenberg/ St James Walkway. They were alerted by the jogger that he was just robbed of his cellphone by a knife-wielding suspect, the City said. "The officers immediately started a search for the suspect and he was apprehended shortly thereafter at St James beach. The victim positively identified the 35-year-old suspect from Lavender Hill. "He was arrested and taken to the Muizenberg police station, where it was discovered he was out on bail for other criminal acts he had allegedly committed. "The victim is commended for his courage in taking a stand against crime by pressing charges against his attacker. So often officers catch these robbers but the victims refuse to press charges. This gives them a chance to continue their criminal acts." Meanwhile, an alleged drug dealer offering discounts on his goods along the Blouberg beachfront is in custody after he was busted in a police sting, News24 reported. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the 46-year-old allegedly first sold two grams of rock cocaine in a sting near a restaurant. The drugs were bought and booked in at Bothasig police. In the second sting operation on Thursday, six ecstasy tablets and eight grams of rock cocaine were bought, with another generous discount thrown into the deal. The suspect's home in Parklands was searched and police allegedly turned up cocaine, MDMA and tik, which they valued at R25 000.
