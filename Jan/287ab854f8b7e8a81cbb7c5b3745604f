Cape Town – The two suspects arrested in connection with the murder of an elderly Ottery couple are expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court today. The couple, both aged 82, was found dead a week ago after their family had lost contact with them. Among those arrested was an acquaintance of the couple, said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut. “The thorough and comprehensive investigation by Lansdowne detectives into the ruthless killing of an elderly Ottery couple in their home on Sunday, January 6, led to the arrest of two male suspects. “Detectives assigned to the case worked around the clock in search of the suspects, who are aged 20 and 29, and who were both arrested at a residence in Delft. “One of the suspects was acquainted with the victims. They are due to make a court appearance in Wynberg on Monday (today),” said Traut. A man living on the Ottery property where the couple had rented a room in the backyard, told the Cape Times that the last time he had seen them alive was on the Saturday morning prior to their deaths. The man said that the couple’s bodies had been discovered by members of their family. He added that the property was quite secure and that the couple would have had to buzz-in any visitors. He said that from what he had seen and heard, whoever was responsible for the murder had probably been trying to rob the couple. Cape Times
