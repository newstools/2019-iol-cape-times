The 26-year-old from Edgemead and his companion were scuba diving just off the shore of Long Beach when he reportedly fell unconscious during an underwater dive. Rescuers at NSRI Station 10 Simon’s Town were summoned by the Cape Medical Response (CMR). NSRI Simon’s Town station commander Darren Zimmerman said: “His dive buddy dumped his scuba gear and took him towards the shore, where he raised the alarm. "Pisces Dive School divers happened to be on the beach at the time and their divers waded into the surf and assisted both men out of the water and commenced CPR efforts on the one man,” he said. “Provincial Health Emergency Medical Services were placed on alert. ‘‘CPR efforts were continued by paramedics and following extensive efforts a pulse was restored and the man was transported to hospital by ambulance in critical condition,” he said. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the other diver was also taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. The Police Dive Unit recovered the dive gear from about 50m offshore at a depth of 6m. The NSRI conveyed their condolences to the family and friends of the Edgemead diver. Cape Times
