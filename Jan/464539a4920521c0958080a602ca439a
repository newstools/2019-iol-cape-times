The unit conducted 81 stop-and-search inspections last week which have yielded fines. Seven joint operations led to the arrest of seven people for various crimes including being in possession of drugs and stolen property and theft of copper, cable and railway signal cable and malicious damage to property and robbery. The unit was launched last year to address the safety concerns that have been affecting Metrorail Western Cape services and infrastructure. Metrorail Western Cape Regional manager Richard Walker said: “It is gratifying to notice the inroads made into criminal incidents affecting the rail service.” He warned that crime bosses would not relinquish profitable businesses easily and that crime may be displaced to other areas. “Without the assistance of all spheres of law enforcement and active community vigilance, the battle will not be easily won,” said Walker. Mayoral committee member for transport Felicity Purchase said the REU’s confiscation of copper railway signal cable should be commended it was vital for urban rail service. She appealed to residents to report suspicious incidents and criminal activities so that those responsible for undermining and sabotaging the passenger rail system could be apprehended. Transport and Public Works MEC Donald Grant was pleased “the REU has encouraged co-operation among law enforcement agencies tasked with keeping communities safe, particularly with the SAPS”.
