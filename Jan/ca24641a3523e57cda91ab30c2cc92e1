Their actions were followed by a string of protests by lobby groups and political parties who denounced the incident as racist. The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (Psira) launched an investigation following the incident . In a statement, the regulatory body said the investigation was concluded but, “due to additional statements from witnesses and complainants, Psira was compelled to institute a full-scale investigation”. Psira’s acting chief executive Mmatlou Sebogodi thanked members of the public who have come forward, saying their information has assisted the investigation. “We are determined to get to the bottom of this matter and we would like to urge members of the public to be patient as we intend to leave no stone unturned.” PPA’s lawyer, Bruce Hendricks, said his client had complied with Psira. “There are those who do not know the true story and they have different views. But there is more to it than meets the eye. We have footage of the night and, from that, it is clear they were not in the wrong.” He said the video was handed over to Psira as part of their investigation and he hoped it would clear PPA. “We trust there will follow due process and the truth will come out.”
