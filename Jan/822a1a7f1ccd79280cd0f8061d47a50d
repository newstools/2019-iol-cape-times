By yesterday afternoon, the municipality said the growing blaze inside the reserve had not yet been contained, burning from the lower to top slopes of the Voorberg mountain above Mooiuitsig, Betty’s Bay. Community members have also offered to donate money to bump up the reward. In a statement, the municipality said the community reported that shortly after midnight a flare, or possibly two flares, were noted. “A reward is being offered to anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the person(s) who used fireworks/flares in the reserve in Betty’s Bay during the early hours of January 1,” the municipality said. Overstrand Municipality fire chief Lester Smith said the municipality went to extreme lengths to ensure the safety of all residents, holidaymakers and the environment, particularly at this time of year. Smith appealed to the public to obey the rules on fireworks and Chinese lanterns. The municipality reported a flare-up yesterday morning and relief crews responded. Strong south-easterly winds caused numerous flare-ups on the fire perimeter, also ruling out aerial support as an option. “The very dry, windy conditions with heavy fuel loads are making the firefighting conditions very difficult,” the municipality said. They thanked the public for donations to firefighters.
