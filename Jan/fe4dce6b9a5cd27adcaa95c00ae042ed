The 35-year-old officer, stationed in Bishop Lavis, was shot and killed during an apparent robbery at a spaza shop in Barcelona informal settlement at about 9pm. Police spokesperson André Traut said police managed to arrest two suspects yesterday, aged 26 and 36, and they are expected to appear in court once charged. Their accomplices and the firearm used in the murder are still being sought by investigators, Traut said. “The provincial commissioner of the Western Cape, Lieutenant-General KE Jula, welcomed the swift arrest of the suspects and warned that serious and violent crimes in this province will be tackled with all our resources to bring an end to the crime spree of criminals who have no regard for the life of others. "Once charged, the suspects are due to make a court appearance in Athlone on a charge of murder,” Traut said. In a separate incident, a 23-year-old alleged gangster from Bishop Lavis was arrested for being in possession of a 9mm pistol, without a serial number, and 16 rounds of ammunition. Traut said the suspect had links to a gang in the area. “With gang violence and associated crimes in our sights, members of Operation Thunder conducted a search operation in Bishop Lavis on Saturday evening, which landed a 23-year-old man behind bars for being in possession of a 9mm pistol, without a serial number, and 16 rounds of ammunition. Lieutenant-General KE Jula said the days are numbered for those responsible for the violence in the gang-affected areas of this province.”
