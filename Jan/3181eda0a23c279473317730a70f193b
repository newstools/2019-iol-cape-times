A video and images did the rounds on social media last week showing the wardens in a parking area, some with glasses of wine. The incident apparently happened sometime last month. Correctional Services Regional Commissioner Delekile Klaas said he was waiting for all the facts but drinking while in uniform was something they didn’t encourage. “We view the allegations in a serious light hence there is an ongoing investigation. We are committed to upholding the highest security standing, especially among our correctional officials, but we do not want to pre-empt anything. "I might be given all the facts on Monday (today) and once I have seen them the report, which will also indicate a step forward, will be released in the week,” Klaas said.
