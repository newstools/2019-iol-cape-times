Cape Town – Six men have been arrested for various crimes relating to housebreaking, theft and possession of ammunition and firearms. Police spokesperson Hein Hendricks said the suspects were arrested following an intelligence-driven operation. “An intelligence-driven operation by SAPS members led to the arrest of six male suspects aged between 26 and 40 on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and presumed stolen property in Kraaifontein. “Maitland Flying Squad members patrolling the Kraaifontein area with the assistance of the K9 unit reacted on information (Thursday) morning about a suspect wanted on a Brackenfell housebreaking and theft case and a Table View pointing-of-firearm case, who was hiding in Lucullus Road, Kraaifontein,” Hendricks said. Police searched the Kraaifontein residence and found an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. A 37-year-old suspect was arrested. Earlier this week, in an unrelated incident at 9am on Wednesday, members of the Kraaifontein SAPS followed up on information about two vehicles transporting stolen copper cables belonging to Eskom and Telkom. “The SAPS members stopped and searched the mentioned bakkies in Industrial Road, Joostenbergvlakte, Kraaifontein and discovered 27 bags containing burnt copper wires. Five suspects aged between 26 and 40 were arrested for possession of presumed stolen property,” Hendricks said. The investigation continues in identifying ownership of the confiscated items. All suspects will appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court once they have been charged.
