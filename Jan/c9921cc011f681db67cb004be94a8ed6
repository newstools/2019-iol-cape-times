The ward became vacant after the previous DA councillor resigned. DA provincial chairperson Bonginkosi Madikizela said it was confident it would retain the ward. The party’s candidate is Theresa Bereniece Thompson. “She is a seasoned politician, she was a councillor before, she was also a sub-council chairperson, she has experience and understands the community and what it takes to be a councillor. However, Madikizela acknowledged the level of service in the community was bad. “The previous ward councillor did the community a huge disservice and we have to fix it. Theresa knows exactly what she needs to do, we are confident things will improve.” EFF provincial chairperson Melikhaya Xego said while it felt the day went well, it hoped residents would give the party a chance. Its candidate is Theresa Amelia Jafta. “So far the response is very well. People are going there, requesting us to make sure we deliver on the manifesto. “We will be pulling our weight. The key issues for the people are a 24-hour clinic, housing and the issue of water meters that were cut off as they were not what they had anticipated. They accommodate big households,” Xego said. The ANC was also in the race with candidate Bazoya Vuyolwetu. ANC provincial spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen said they hoped to improve their support base in the ward. “Our message is one of renewal, non-racism, non-sexism, against gangsterism, a new dawn and we are in support of the new dawn. We have a message of hope and unity.” The results are expected to be released today. Nicola Daniels
