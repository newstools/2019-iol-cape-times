Cape Town – Mopping-up operations took place this morning following a veld fire which destroyed two houses and injured a firefighter in Mossel Bay. While there were no evacuations on Monday, Mossel Bay resident Jacqui Swanepoel told News24 on Tuesday there had been "chaos" as residents could not reach their homes due to road closures. It had been difficult to contain the fire, the cause of which is still unknown, as it was fanned by strong winds in the Hartenbos Heuwels area. Firefighters from the George Municipality, Garden Route District Municipality and Working on Fire crews were called in to assist yesterday. "Although there were only two properties that were completely lost. There were a few other properties with damage," said Swanepoel, who added that the stench of the fire was still hanging in the air. "Our local fire department was great! Thanks to them, there were only two properties lost."
