Cape Town –  Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security; and Social Services JP Smith on Monday confirmed as authentic a video clip doing the rounds on social media of a high-speed crash on the N1 outgoing at the Sable Road off-ramp. Smith said the incident happened just after midnight today, leaving the driver of the BMW seriously injured. "The incident is just the latest example of the devastation wrought by illegal street racers on our streets. What is equally concerning is the group of people gathered on the overpass filming the incident. "It is representative of an ongoing problem that our traffic officers have to contend with week in and week out, particularly the Ghost Squad. "Fortunately, this time, no other persons were hurt, but there have been plenty of cases before where innocent persons have paid with their lives because of the recklessness and arrogance of others. "The Traffic Service is unable to prosecute motorists on the strength of third-party evidence such as the video footage that is being circulated. However, the South African Police Service is able to pursue a case and we hope that they will do so in this instance. "The City has engaged with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) about this matter and they have informed us that they are not legally able to open cases or issue notices based on statements from members of the public and that only SAPS may investigate such cases when a member of the public submits a complaint."
