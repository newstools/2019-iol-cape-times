SAPS spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said that on New Year's Eve, police officers patrolling Browns Farm had noticed a suspicious-looking car. “When they signalled for the vehicle to stop, the driver accelerated, but they were caught and a firearm, gas gun, cellphone and the vehicle were confiscated. Four suspects, aged between 25 and 36, were arrested. “The four are expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court once charged for the possession of an illegal firearm and stolen property,” Van Wyk said. On the same day, Van Wyk said, the police also arrested a 30-year-old man for car hijacking. “Fourteen other suspects were arrested during raids conducted at illegal liquor outlets in Browns Farm, in Crossroads and Nyanga, where 927.64 litres of liquor were confiscated. "The suspects are due to appear in the Philippi Magistrate's Court for dealing in liquor,” Van Wyk said.
