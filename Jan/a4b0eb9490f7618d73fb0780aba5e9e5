Cape Town – The trial of the man accused of starting the devastating Betty's Bay fire in the Overstrand region has been postponed again. The 34-year-old Shelton April was arrested after he allegedly set off a flare on New Year's Eve that ignited the blaze in the mountains near Betty's Bay, which spread to Pringle Bay, Hangklip, Rooi Els, the Kogel Bay Nature Reserve, Franskraal and Hermanus. He is set to make another appearance on January 23, where prosecutors are expected to bring further charges against him. April remains in custody. A Pringle Bay woman is suspected to have died of smoke inhalation, while the fire destroyed more than 30 houses, partially damaging an equal number, and thousands of hectares of vegetation. On Monday, the Overstrand Municipality said efforts to contain the fires across the area have been largely successful and mop-up operations are ongoing. While a fire is still burning in the Hermanus/Franskraal area to the east of Betty's Bay, no properties are in danger at this time. Meanwhile, a small antelope, named Bambi, that was badly burnt in the Betty's Bay fire is recovering well at an animal clinic in Somerset West, the SABC reported. The Cape grysbok, which was found by firefighters on Friday evening, was rushed by paramedics to vets on duty. Dr Ingrid de Wet, from Ebervet Country Animal Clinic, said Bambi was dehydrated and in a lot of pain, with burns on his ears, nose and hooves. Commenting on his remarkable recovery, she said: “Today he's looking much happier, walking around, drinking milk and has started eating a few leaves, which we're very excited about. "Fortunately, his burn wounds are not too extensive, but he still has got a long road of recovery ahead of him. There are many people praying for little Bambi, as we have named him, and we're sure he'll make a good recovery with all of the love and care he is receiving. We also had a number of offers for rehabilitation."
