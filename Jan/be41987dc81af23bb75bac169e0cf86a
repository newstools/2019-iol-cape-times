Local Government Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell and officials from the national Department of Water and Sanitation visited the region last week to assess the situation. Bredell said the project could cost an estimated R91.2 million, of which the first phase is set to cost R50m. The decision to move forward with the project, known as the Blossoms Water Supply Pipeline, was taken during the visit. “We want to ensure the town has another supply of water besides the existing Raubenheimer Dam. The Blossoms project basically amounts to putting in a 22km pipeline and pumping infrastructure from existing boreholes that have been drilled in the Blossoms area, to the town’s existing water network. "The water source is strong enough to supply up to half of the town’s drinking water. The pipeline will also be linked to the existing Klein Karoo Rural Water Supply Scheme, which provides some water to the Kannaland municipality.” Bredell said drought relief funding of R30m that has already been given to the town would be utilised to get the project going. “Additional funding will be sourced from the national Department of Water and Sanitation, the provincial government as well as the council of Oudtshoorn. “This project will also bring much-needed water security to Calitzdorp and Dysselsdorp. We hope to get this project rolling as soon as possible. "It must be stated that Oudtshoorn currently does have water with the existing dam about 47% full following recent rainfall.” Officials also visited the Beaufort West and Kannaland municipalities, where they were informed of the situation in the regions regarding the drought crisis.
