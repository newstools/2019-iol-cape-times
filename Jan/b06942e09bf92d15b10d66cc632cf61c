Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the man, 35, arrested on Thursday was due to appear in court. “A robbery common case was opened for investigation after a Taxify driver was robbed of his belongings, at about 7.45pm,” she said. He became the third Taxify driver to be robbed in a space of three weeks. Taxify did not respond by deadline. Police were still searching for suspects who allegedly hijacked another driver in Grassy Park last week. The driver, 42, had picked up a passenger in Plumstead to Grassy Park and the passenger’s friend in Zeekoevlei on January 13, before being directed to a dead end and allegedly threatened with knives. The suspects fled with the driver’s vehicle, wallet and R310, and cellphone. Rwexana said police were following leads on another driver who was attacked and robbed by passengers before an attack by residents in Manenberg. The driver, 28, who was admitted to hospital, had picked up five passengers in Mitchells Plain after being called via his on-board e-hailing app. As the three remaining male passengers approached their destination, the driver was beaten over the head with a bottle and robbed. He was rescued by a pastor of a nearby church. Anyone with information about the incidents can anonymously contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.
