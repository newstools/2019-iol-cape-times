Cape Town – A former Adult Basic Education and Training (Abet) teacher is expected to appear in court again next month on fraud charges to the tune of almost R1 million. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said Tasmyn Lynn Dorothy, 42, appeared in the Oudtshoorn Magistrate’s Court for alleged fraud on August 12, following her arrest the same day. “It is alleged that between January 2010 and May 2013 Dorothy, who worked as a teacher and a manager at different learning centres around Oudtshoorn, registered ghost learners, thereby inflating the actual numbers of registered students in order to gain financial benefits from the Western Cape Department of Education, which consequently lost R946 538 from her illegal activities,” said Nkwalase. The former teacher was released on R2 500 bail until her next regional court date on September 6. Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said: “The WCED were made aware of financial irregularities and investigated the matter. "The case was handed over to provincial forensic services.” Following an investigation, Dorothy was dismissed. Cape Times
