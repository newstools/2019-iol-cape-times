Judge Mark Sher meted out the sentences in the Circuit High Court in Mossel Bay on Monday. Lekoro was convicted on Friday for murdering 72-year-old Mattheus “Tewie” Human and his 62-year-old wife Eurika at their smallholding close to the N2 highway between Mossel Bay and George last June. Tewie was hacked with a panga and his wife stabbed to death. For the two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, Sher deviated from the prescribed minimum sentence of 15 years and handed him an additional 36 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery (18 years for each victim). Sher said: “Although Lekoro will be serving life in prison, other people who would think of doing the same should understand that the courts are getting tired (of) dealing with brutal robberies of old fragile people in society. “The murders were cold-blooded and premeditated. Even though the court can do nothing to undo the damage Lekoro inflicted on the Human family they could, however, ensure that he is removed from society.” The judge also praised prosecutor Lenro Badenhorst who gave the order that a laptop and cellphone police found in Lekoro’s possession had to be analysed. National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “The NPA welcomed the sentence and believe that it fits the gruesome crime that was committed by Lekoro. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
