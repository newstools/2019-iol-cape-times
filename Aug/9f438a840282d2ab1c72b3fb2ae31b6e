Cape Town - The South African Police Services (SAPS) have confirmed that they are investigating a robbery that took place at Kenilworth Centre on Monday morning. The robbers had allegedly entered the Foschini store with guns and hammers, leaving cellphone boxes and shattered glass in their wake. SAPS spokesperson Andrè Traut confirmed that they are looking into the matter. "This morning at around 11:10 armed suspects held the staff of a clothing store in a Kenilworth mall at gunpoint and fled with jewellery, cellular telephones and cash. They fled with a silver Chevrolet SUV with false number plates and are yet to be arrested." Earlier this month, another incident took place at the Watergate Mall in Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain, where four armed robbers entered the Butcher Shoppe and demanded cash from the cashiers before fleeing the scene. On July 31, brazen robbers also walked into the Cell C Store in Westgate Mall, Mitchells Plain, and demanded cellphones and cellphone gadgets. The duo allegedly also took cellphones belonging to customers and fled in a white Toyota Hilux. Cape Argus
