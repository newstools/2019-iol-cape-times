Last week, Judge President John Hlope ordered that sentencing proceedings be set down for December 9, 10 and 11. This after advocate Ayanda Gladile, appearing for the accused, said the defence was not ready to proceed and needed time to prepare. State advocate Nokuzola Mbewana indicated that the prosecution was ready to go ahead with sentencing proceedings. Mtala escaped on May 17 after appearing in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court with another accused, who was due to be released on the same day, while Mtala was supposed to go back to Pollsmoor Prison. Mtala was convicted on three counts of murder and three counts of possession of an illegal firearm. The murders were committed in 2016. In postponing the matter Hlope said: “This is a dangerous man and I’ve ordered that he be chained. The next time he appears in this court I want to see his hands and legs chained.” vincent,cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
