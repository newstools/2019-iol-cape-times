Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said police had attended to a complaint at Judge Street at around 7.30pm on Monday. “A case of murder has been opened for investigation following the discovery of the body of an unknown victim who was stoned to death by unknown suspects who are sought by the police,” Rwexana said. Residents said “thugs” were terrorising the area as every day a person was robbed of their belongings. Mfuleni ward councillor Thembisile Batembu said: “In Mfuleni we have a huge challenge. “Every week a murder is reported and this has to do with less police visibility at the area. The community has been complaining about the police arriving late at the scene and not arresting those who have committed crime. " Another thing that we need to look at is the fact that we don’t have a neighbourhood watch in the area, and that is why crime is increasing day to day. " The community needs to co-operate with the police and not turn a blind eye when crime is committed.” Anyone with information can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
