Mark Lawson of CycleTheCape.com and his team of cyclists hit the road on Nelson Mandela Day. They cycled 2 830km, through wind and heat as they followed the fibre optic route collecting data, photos and video footage. Called the Long Ride To Freedom project, it was a collaboration between James van der Hoven, who heads up Leaderless (an education platform teaching people how to take advantage of the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution), Lawson, the Fibre Council of SA, and the E-commerce Forum Africa. “Every project Leaderless undertakes will show people how they can use technology to fight corruption and greed and replace it with collaboration, love and mutual respect for our fellow citizens and our environment. ‘‘We want to encourage collaboration over competition as this is the only way that we will be able to survive in a world where robots and artificial intelligence will remove jobs as we know them. ‘‘Trust was at the heart of the message we carried. Trust in e-commerce to create jobs that will clean up our planet,” said Hoven.
