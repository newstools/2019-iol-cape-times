Cape Town – The Salvation Army Carehaven in Athlone offers sanctuary and short-term housing to up to 60 women who are victims of domestic abuse and their children. However, remorseless thieves seem to have little compassion and have targeted the safe haven several times in the past few weeks. Salvation Army spokesperson Major Carin Holmes said on Friday the break-ins are causing extensive damage to its premises and creating secondary trauma for its residents, the SABC reported. One in every four women is a victim of domestic violence and every six hours a woman is killed by her intimate partner. Many women fall into a cycle of abuse, moving from one destructive situation to another. Holmes said they have reported the matter to the police before but there is no end to these attacks on the vulnerable and needy. “We've sharpened up the security. You know, we've upgraded the Salvation Army and Carehaven and we have only so much money. "Because of the safety of people, we are asking if there is anybody out there who can help or come and give some consultation free of charge and tell us about the best way to go about these things,” Holmes said.
