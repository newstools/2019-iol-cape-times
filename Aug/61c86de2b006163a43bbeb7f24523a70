Cape Town – An investigation has been launched into the deaths of a shipment of 5 300 crabs that were allegedly left in the sun for nine days at OR Tambo International Airport. The crabs were reportedly found at a cargo facility at the airport by the National Council of SPCAs (NCSPA). Inspectors found the crabs were either dead or dying and infested with maggots. They had gone without food and water for about nine days, according to the NCSPA. Inspectors euthanised more than half of the crabs, which were still alive after the shipment had come from Mozambique on August 18. The shipment was reportedly meant to be sent to Hong Kong, but due to the unrest there the flight had been cancelled. NCSPA special projects unit manager Arno de Klerk said: “From our side the investigation is in progress. As soon as it has been concluded we will decide what the next steps will be. "At this stage of the investigation I can’t say who we are investigating. We will look at all the evidence that we have gathered and then we will say what our next step will be. “I can’t say how long (our investigation) will take, but we are trying to conclude the investigation as soon as possible.” The crabs had allegedly been packaged and restrained by the company that shipped them, according to the NSPCA, which accused the company of not having adhered to International Air Transport Association regulations.
