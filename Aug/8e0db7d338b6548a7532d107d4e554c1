The 15-year-old has been dominating the local junior scene and won a few titles in Europe over the past few years. At the Crankworx Whistler Mountain Bike Festival, which took place in Canada earlier this month, Ike competed in the Youth 15 to 16 division and placed seventh. “Crankworx was the two best weeks of my life. It has been a dream to go to Whistler for a long time, so it was super sick to go there during the best time, during Crankworx. "Our division was pretty quick, and I was placed fifth, but ended up seventh after a couple of riders had re-runs on a faster track,” he said. The Audi Nines Mountain Bike event 2019 is a freeride and slopestyle mountain bike event, in partnership with Bikepark Idarkopf. “I’m really hyped for Audi Nines as it’s the biggest official invite I have ever received, and all the pro guys are there, so it’s a huge event. It’s super-special to be invited, and I can’t wait,” Ike said. Locally he has earned himself multiple Western Province Championships and he is the current SA under-17 DH Champion and the Cup Series Champ. Klaassen lives in Stellenbosch, where he has access to many trails.
