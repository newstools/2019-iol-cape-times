Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott confirmed that two train carriages, part of train number 3219 en route to Strand, caught fire. "The incident impacts all inbound/outbound Strand trains that are forced to terminate at Firgrove Station until further notice. Commuters are advised to make alternative transport arrangements between Firgrove and Strand," she said. "Mop-up operations will commence after the train has been moved to the depot and safety tests have been conducted to assess whether underlying or overhead infrastructure suffered damage as a result of the fire. "The cost of the damage will only be confirmed once Prasa's loss adjusters have assessed the carriages." On July 8, a Cape Town-bound train from Strand caught fire between Melton Rose and Blackheath stations, with one motor coach being affected. Metrorail response teams had to rush to switch off the overhead electricity to enable firefighters to safely extinguish the fire. Two commuters sustained minor injuries after being forced to jump from the train.
