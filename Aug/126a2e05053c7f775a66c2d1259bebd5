Cape Town â€“ The Western Cape SAPS management has assembled a team of organised crime detectives to probe three incidents where people were shot and killed in the early hours of this morning. In one incident in the Siqalo informal settlement in Philippi, three males between the ages of 20 and 30 were found lying in the street with bullet wounds to their heads, police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said on Tuesday. In Leiden, Delft, a 60-year-old woman and a 27-year-old male were found shot dead in a house, while another occupant was injured. Meanwhile in the Nyanga area, in Samora Machel, people on their way to work discovered two bodies of unknown women lying next to the road after 5am. "They had been shot in the upper parts of their bodies," Van Wyk said. Anyone with information about any of these incidents is urged to contact Lieutenant-Colonel Eddie Clarke on 082 469 1531.
