Cape Town - The Delft Neighbourhood Safety Team (NST) made a big bust on Thursday when they uncovered six firearms while on patrol in Leiden. Mayco Member for Safety and Security JP Smith revealed that NST members were patrolling the Leiden area at approximately 9 pm when they spotted the three suspects. "NST members saw 2 suspect males and 1 female, and upon approaching the suspects to perform a search, the lady tried running away. A female officer gave chase and got her. Upon searching the female, the metro cop found a firearm in her panty," Smith said. "The female suspect then admitted that she is the carrier of the firearm and gave information about more firearms that were hidden on their premises. "NST members conducted a premises search on the information given and found 6 firearms on the premises with 30 9mm live rounds and one 2.2 rounds. Suspects are currently being detained at SAPS."
