I knew that to live a fulfilling life I had to live a purposeful life; a life of service. ‘‘I believe that every single person was brought into this world for a purpose and that we should never leave the world as we found it but should always strive to make a positive change,” she said. “At a young age I did not have a clear idea of how I would achieve this, but I knew I had to find a way to be impactful and to be a catalyst for positive change in my community, and even the world. “Finally, everything has come full circle as I find myself with the Miss South Africa crown, ready to deliver on the promises I have been making since I was a child. ‘‘I am inspired by the likes of Steve Biko, Nelson Mandela, Princess Diana and others of their calibre. They understood fully what it meant to be selfless. “As Miss South Africa, I cannot wait to make a contribution to important social causes.” Cape Times
