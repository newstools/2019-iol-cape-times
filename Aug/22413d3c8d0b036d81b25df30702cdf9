The AAS is a group of individuals and entities within the academic book supply industry, including the SA Booksellers Association and the Publishers Association of SA. “We believe that the decision to disburse R5000 in cash to NSFAS students has already caused unintended consequences and will have a profoundly negative impact on students’ success rates at tertiary institutions,” AAS convener Mohamed Kharwa said. “Since the change of policy at the start of the year, academic book sales have dropped dramatically - most notably, but certainly not exclusively, where a high proportion of students previously used their ring-fenced NSFAS book allowance. “For example, at universities with a 90%-plus dependence on NSFAS funding, book unit sales dropped between an alarming 60% to 91%.” The organisation added that it believed the allowance that was previously ring-fenced for spending on books was now being spent on other items. The NSFAS did not respond by the time of publication.
