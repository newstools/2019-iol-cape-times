The five-year One Ocean Hub aims to bridge disconnections between law, science and policy in addressing global ocean challenges, and will do so through transdisciplinary and innovative research, and by integrating governance frameworks to balance ocean uses with conservation. Senior researcher at UCT’s Marine Research Institute Dr Lynne Shannon will lead the development of ecosystem models complemented by indicator-based assessments. “Despite the multifaceted role the ocean plays in our well-being - and survival - various large-scale challenges are pushing ocean ecosystems beyond their limits. "These challenges range from overexploitation and multiple competing uses, to pollution and climate change. "While many people, institutions and organisations have dedicated themselves to turning the tide on ocean degradation, they are losing ground, in part due to a lack of collaboration and integration,” UCT said.
