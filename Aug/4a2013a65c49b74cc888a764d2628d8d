National Search and Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said they were alerted to a drowning at around 4.30pm on Saturday. “The child, reported to be amongst a group of local friends who were swimming together, was reported by witnesses to have disappeared under water after appearing to be in difficulty in the surf while swimming,” Lambinon said. Police said they were investigating. “A search for a missing 12-year-old boy is under way in Strand following the disappearance of the boy yesterday. Investigation is on-going,” said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. The NSRI rescue craft Spirit of Surfski and Mercantile Spirit were launched as well as NSRI rescue swimmers, provincial paramedics, EMS, a Skymed rescue helicopter, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services and their rescue dive unit. “Despite an extensive search sadly no sign of the child has been found and the Police Dive Unit are continuing in an ongoing search supported by NSRI Strand, Strand Surf Lifesaving, CoCT Law Enforcement Marine and Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services dive unit. "Trauma counsellors assisted family of the missing child and our thoughts are with them,” Lambinon said yesterday. Cape Times
