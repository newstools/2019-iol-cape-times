Cape Town – Springbok rugby star Eben Etzebeth has denied allegations that he physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan at the weekend. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Etzebeth, who has captained the Boks, said: "It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media. Multiple witnesses can corroborate that. "I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport that I love." The Stormers lock, who has 78 Test caps, is expected to be named in Rassie Erasmus' 31-man squad for next month's Rugby World Cup in Japan this afternoon. Accusations on social media and a video circulated alleged Etzebeth had assaulted and pointed a gun at a homeless man in the West Coast town. According to Netwerk24, a charge has been laid and those involved in the incident are being questioned. Cape Times
