“We are receiving hundreds of calls, emails and SMSes every day from people who are desperate for help, info and referrals. “The need to create awareness on mental health in all communities across the country is incredibly important right now, so according to us at Sadag, every month should be Mental Health Awareness Month,” the organisation said. Sadag has over 200 support groups across the country in areas such as Pretoria, Benoni, George, Fish Hoek, Durbanville, Mahikeng, Potchefstroom and Berea. It said support groups played an important role in assistance for people suffering from depression and other mental health issues. “We always encourage members of the community who are interested in making a difference to consider starting a support group, and we can help them start up, step by step. A new depression and anxiety support group launches on Saturday at 2pm at Life Glynnview Hospital in Benoni. If you would like to join a support group in your area, call Sadag at 0800 708 090.
