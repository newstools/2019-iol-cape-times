The sites have a combined size of about 40 hectares and a commercial value of R316 million, according to mayoral committee member for spatial planning Marian Nieuwoudt. Nieuwoudt said: “By making available the sites to the private sector for development we can ignite much-needed urban renewal in these areas, economic growth and job creation. “The sites are also ideal for higher-density housing as they are close to train stations, minibus-taxi services and bus stops.” The sites are the Athlone station car park, Mouquet Farm in Diep River, the Tygerdal site at the Monte Vista station in Goodwood and the Kapteinsklip station precinct in Mitchells Plain. Detail will be made available to the public from Thursday at www.capetown.gov.za/haveyoursay and at sub-council offices and public libraries across Cape Town.
