CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court is on Thursday expected to give judgement on whether to release businessman and convicted wife killer Jason Rohde on bail, pending the outcome of his appeal. The matter was heard at the high court in Cape Town on Wednesday last week and judgement was reserved. This followed after Rohde’s legal team launched the application for bail after being granted leave to appeal his conviction by the Supreme Court of Appeal last month. In papers before the court, Rohde had stated that he wanted to be released on bail so that he could attend to his business affairs and maintain his children financially. Rohde is currently serving an effective 20 years at the Drakenstein Prison in Paarl for killing his wife Susan and obstructing the ends of justice by staging her suicide. Susan Rohde’s body was found in a locked bathroom in a room she shared with Rohde in July 2016 at the Spier Wine Estate Hotel in Stellenbosch. Her body was found with an electronic cord wrapped around her neck. The cord had been tied to a hook on the back of the bathroom door. In February, Rohde was sentenced to 18 years for murder by Western Cape High Court Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe, and five years for obstructing the course of justice, with three years of the sentence running concurrently with the murder charge.
