Cape Town â€“ A 14-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly killing a woman believed to his mother in Kuils River. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said on Sunday officers had attended to a "complaint" in Elmarie Street, Kalkfontein, around 6.45pm on Saturday. "Upon arrival on the scene, they found the 55-year-old victim laying on the ground with multiple stab wounds to her body," he said. Officers immediately called paramedics, who later declared the single mother, who was a nurse, dead. The teenager is due to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court today on charges of murder, Van Wyk said. The 55-year-old woman had apparently scolded the boy for sleeping out on Friday night, the Daily Voice reported. "She took a frying pan to give him a hiding and then he grabbed it from her. "She grabbed a knife and then he grabbed that from her and stabbed her," a neighbour said. The woman had rushed out of the house, with neighbours coming to her aid, but died before an ambulance could get to her. Anyone with information or who witnessed the incident can contact the Kuils River SAPS on 021 900 2800 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Cape Times
