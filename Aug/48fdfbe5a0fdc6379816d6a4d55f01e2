“I usually use my imagination whenever I draw. Zozibini’s sketch was my first time stepping out of my comfort zone and it felt amazing,” Mantshiyose said. Originally from the Eastern Cape, Mantshiyose has always had a love for the arts. She said Tunzi was an inspiration to many young women, that they could achieve whatever they set their minds to. “The day I watched Miss South Africa, I didn’t even know the contestants, but when I heard that Zozibini was from Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, I was glued to the TV screen. “I was in awe of her beauty, and that she was brave enough to enter the competition. I knew from that moment that Zozibini, with her confidence, was my role model,” Mantshiyose said. Mantshiyose’s mother, Phindiwe Mantshiyose, said her daughter displayed a drawing talent from a young age. She then enrolled her at the Lady Grey Arts Academy, where she studied drama. Unfortunately, Mantshiyose had to drop out due to a lack of funds. “I couldn’t let my daughter’s talent goes unnoticed, I had to nurture it,” said Phindiwe. Cape Times
