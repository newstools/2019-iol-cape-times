"Circumstances surrounding this incident are being investigated, with no arrests made so far. Police detectives are following up all leads to bring the perpetrators to book." In March, a Muizenberg High School matric pupil, Janet Ntozini, 18, was stabbed three times in the back when, according to a witness, she had tried to convince a 23-year-old man he could not attack an unarmed, disabled 19-year-old man over a disagreement they had. The witness said Ntozini had seen the suspect wielding a knife when he approached the helpless 19-year-old. Ntozini was then stabbed in the side. “When she fell to the ground, he stabbed her in the back,” said the witness. Cape Times
