Cape Town –  Just after 6am today the City's Fire and Rescue Service had to respond to disused wooden train carriages that caught fire at the Transnet Marshalling Yard in Bellville. Three firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 14 staff members were dispatched, according to the Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse. "The officer of the first arriving appliance confirmed that it was disused wooden carriages that were alight. The fire has been contained and no injuries were reported," Carelse said. A firefighter sustained a minor injury after the City's Fire and Rescue Service had been called out just before 8pm on Sunday, July 21, after disused train carriages caught fire in Woodstock. Ten firefighting appliances, a rescue vehicle and 21 Fire and Rescue Service staff members were called on to douse disused wooden carriages on different railway lines that had caught fire, Carelse said at the time.
