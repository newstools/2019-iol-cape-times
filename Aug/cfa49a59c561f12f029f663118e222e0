Cape Town – Provincial biodiversity entity CapeNature has spent R39.4 million over the past four years in tackling alien vegetation infestation on CapeNature-managed land. Environmental Affairs, Development Planning and Local Government MEC Anton Bredell said alien invasive species had a detrimental impact on water catchment areas and therefore programmes to tackle the problem were crucial. “We’re spending millions every year across the province in efforts to tackle the scourge. We’d love to do more but the budget is severely constrained.” Bredell said every nature reserve in the Western Cape under the management of CapeNature had an Invasive Alien Control Plan. “Annually, CapeNature prioritises invasive alien plant-clearing per reserve based on this plan. CapeNature’s prioritisation is based on biodiversity and ecological considerations to protect the ecosystem functioning of these areas as a whole. "In collaboration with our partners, including national government entities, we’ve also prioritised which catchments are most important to manage in terms of addressing water-provision concerns,” Bredell said. CapeNature estimates that 46% of the property it manages can be classified as low density when it comes to the presence of alien vegetation. Some 27% can be classified as moderate density, with a further 27% classified as high-density infestations. Bredell said there was no doubt clearing alien vegetation yielded greater water security and environmental sustainability. “But once cleared, properties must be maintained as reinvasions from seed banks and neighbouring invasion sources are a problem.”
