Cape Town – An 11-year-old boy has been arrested for the possession of an unlicensed firearm next to a school in Cravenby Estate – with the firearm in hand. There are allegations that the child had been sent to attack another child at the school and threatened a teacher in the process. "Officers attached to the Law Enforcement Liquor Unit arrested an 11-year-old boy for the possession of an unlicensed firearm earlier," mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said on Tuesday. "Officers were driving through Cravenby Estate when they were flagged down by a member of the public, who raised the alarm. They searched the area and found the boy next to a school in the area, firearm in hand." "The details around the case are yet to be determined, but there are allegations that the child was sent to attack another child at the school and threatened a teacher in the process. "This is deeply disturbing and we hope that the appropriate social services interventions can take place to put this young boy on a different path. "I also urge the South African Police Service to get to the bottom of this matter and find whoever was responsible for putting a firearm in the hands of this minor." Cape Times
