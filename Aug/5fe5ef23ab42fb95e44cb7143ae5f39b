“PSFA is extremely concerned about the increase of plastic pollution and this is our small contribution towards a global movement to becoming a plastic free society,” said Petrina Pakoe, director of PSFA. PSFA will be partnering with Sasko and various private schools whose pupils will be encouraged to bring bread bags to school and place them in a special Sasko/Blisters for Bread box for recycling. The participating schools will be rewarded with donations of school books, which will, in turn, be donated to schools on PSFA’s feeding programme. The Blisters for Bread event will take place at the Green Point Cricket Club on Sunday, and includes two routes along the Sea Point Promenade: a 10km walk that starts at 7.30am; and a 5km walk that starts at 8am. South African pop sensations Paxton and Jarrad Ricketts will be performing live at the finish line. The entry fee is R60 a person, which will enable PSFA to provide 24 schoolchildren from poverty-stricken backgrounds with a cooked breakfast and lunch for a day. Enter online at www.psfa.org.za
