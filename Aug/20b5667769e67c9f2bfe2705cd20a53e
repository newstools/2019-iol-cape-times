Cape Town – In 2017, a Clifton parking bay raised eyebrows for its R990 000 price tag, which was snapped up by a German investor. Parking is now probably even more sought-after in the upmarket Atlantic Seaboard suburb, with another parking bay up for grabs at R1.25 million. And it's not even enclosed parking, being on the roof of the San Michele apartment building in Victoria Street, which offers easy access to Clifton 1st beach. According to the Dogon Group, which advertised it as a "rare and sought-after, secure parking bay", calculated over 20 years at 10.0% with no deposit, the monthly bond repayment is R12 062.77 Adrien Epstein, luxury property consultant at Dogon Group, said: “For a parking to be available in a such prime location like this is incredibly rare. "Many of the buildings in this area were built in the 1950s where it was common to simply park your car on the street, and now there is a shortage of them."
