Cape Town – Refusing to open the door isn't going work when law enforcement officials come knocking – not when they have received a tip-off. Running away could also backfire, as a suspect's wife was arrested after he had run away. Metro Police officers teamed up with SAPS Crime Intelligence in Athlone last night to investigate a tip-off about drugs and firearms being kept at a house in Athlone, the City said on Friday. "While driving to the address, officers found themselves behind a VW Polo that turned out to go to the house in question. "The driver pulled into the garage and closed the door before officers could get in – he then refused to open the door. "Officers kept knocking until someone else opened a door… and headed straight for the garage to search the vehicle. "They found a bag of tik underneath the car, which provided reasonable grounds to search the whole house. "In a safe, they found another bag of tik and R29 000 in cash. The tik collectively weighed 208 grams, with an estimated street value of R38 000. "As the driver of the Polo had run away, officers took into custody a 27-year-old woman who indicated that she is his wife."
