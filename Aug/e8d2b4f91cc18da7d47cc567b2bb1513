Even though the clinic sterilises animals every day, it said that the pet population kept growing. On average it sterilises 2 500 animals a year. Fundraising and communications manager Marcelle du Plessis said the sterilisations made a large dent considering that one dog and its mate can result in about 67 000 puppies in six years if neither of them or their puppies are ever sterilised. “At the same time there are many superstitions around sterilisation such as, that a dog will pick up weight if it is sterilised or that a male dog will no longer be manly and protect the home. These are misconceptions and not true,” Du Plessis said. Between 8am and 1pm on August 17 animal lovers from across Cape Town can visit the Mdzananda Animal Clinic to meet the dogs and cats up for adoption. The adoption process includes a R600 adoption fee which covers the pet’s sterilisation costs as well as vaccinations.
