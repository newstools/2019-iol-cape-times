Cape Town – Police have arrested two remote jamming suspects in Sea Point after they tried to jam the car of a Law Enforcement officer on the Foreshore. The suspects, aged 30 and 32, had earlier also been spotted in Rondebosch after alleged remote jamming activities in the area on Thursday morning, but managed to escape after a chase. "Two remote-jamming suspects got in a jam of their own this morning (Thursday) when they were caught by Metro Police officers in Sea Point," City of Cape Town Law Enforcement spokesperson Ruth Solomons said. "The suspects popped onto the radar of enforcement agencies last night when they tried to jam the car of a Law Enforcement officer on the Foreshore. "He provided a description of the vehicle and this morning Rondebosch SAPS were alerted to remote jamming activities in the area, but the suspects – in the same vehicle - got away during a chase. "Their story eventually ended in Sea Point at around 10:30 when Metro Police officers on patrol spotted the Renault Clio and moved in. "Two suspects, aged 30 and 32, were arrested. The car turned out to be a rental and officers also recovered several remote jamming devices. "The Metro Police Department reminds the public to be extra vigilant when they’re out and about and to double check that their vehicles are in fact properly secured before moving off, as criminals are becoming ever more creative in their attempts to exploit unsuspecting victims."
