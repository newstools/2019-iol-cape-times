Linathi Titshala, 9, went missing on December 16 last year after she left her grandmother’s house in Cork Tree Street, Thubelitsha, to walk to her mom’s house, only three doors away. She was wearing black jeans, a grey top and black slippers. Her mother Siphokazi said: “This will be the second Christmas without her and I’ll never get used to it. This made me paranoid, I constantly worry about the safety of my other two children. "As parents we always make sure we warn our children about not going to play far, not to come home late or walk alone when they are far from home. Linathi was taken in the morning a few meters from her house,” she said. Police spokesperson Siyabulela Malo said they were still investigating.
