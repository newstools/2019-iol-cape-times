The District Six Civic Association’s Asa Salie said the illegal land invasion was a problem it had been facing for a long time. “Now, the crime has definitely increased and this we can easily say that it’s due to the increase of people living on the fields surrounding District Six. However anyone wants to say it, we are directly affected by it. There are still taxis parking at the circle at the bottom of Russell Street and this has been reported to the ward councillor. “The occupation of the vacant land, hopefully will be something of the past once construction starts in District Six. However, the construction, to start as soon as 2020, does not seem to be where the occupation is right now so we will continue to have this problem until the entire District Six is developed,” Salie said. “The City says its hands are tied due to the high court case going on about the homeless. The homeless are not the people to be worried about with crime; they are not the problem. “It’s the crime being committed by those using the vacant land to sell drugs that is affecting the youth in District Six and that is what should be addressed. So yes, crime for the returnees to District Six has been on the increase. The majority of the elderly are targets for crime.” In October, residents of Zonnebloem started a petition in a bid to prevent illegal squatting and reduce crime in the area. The online petition was started to call for improved services in Zonnebloem and to help residents prevent squatting and curb crime. The City’s law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said: “The Law Enforcement Department is fully aware of the ongoing problem of displaced people setting up shelters in public open space. This is an ongoing issue not only in District Six but in other areas as well. Significant resources are directed towards this problem and officers deal with this type of situation in a very sensitive manner.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
