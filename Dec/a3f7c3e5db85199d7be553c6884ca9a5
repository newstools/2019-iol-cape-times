The charges stem from an investigation that began in August 2016 that focused on alleged abalone smuggling in Gansbaai, Hermanus, Hawston, Bredasdorp, Stanford and Kuils River. The group appeared briefly before Judge Mushtak Parker in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday for pre-trial purposes. One of the original suspects, Donavan Williams, was killed in a shooting incident earlier this year. It is alleged that the officials colluded with syndicates by selling seized abalone back to smugglers and facilitating the transportation of illegal abalone. The officials who allegedly colluded with syndicates are Adam Baadjies, Rudolf Louw, Allistair Maans, Craven Mxaku, Linda Nkeleni, Winston Busch, John Karelse, Nomvuyo Motloung and Zihle Diko. The other accused are Solomon Sauls, Frederick Myburg, Dennis Swarts, Eugene Herandien, Preston Julies, Ricard Malan and Steven Dlovo. Another accused, Cotlet May, entered into a plea bargaining agreement. Following a joint multi-disciplinary operation carried out by the Hawks, the Tactical Response Team, the department and the Asset Forfeiture Unit, both Baadjies and Diko were denied bail on June 13 last year, while all the other officials were released on R20000 bail with stringent conditions. Two of the alleged syndicate kingpins, Sauls and Herandien, were also denied bail, while others were granted R50000 bail each and Swarts was released on R20000 bail. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
