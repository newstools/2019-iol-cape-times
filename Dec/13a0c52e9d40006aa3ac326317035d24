Cape Town – Another rescue attempt had to be launched at Voëlklip beach, near Herolds Bay, after a red Chevrolet Spark plunged into the sea last night. It occurred at the same lookout point, with a 100m drop, that claimed the lives of a Herolds Bay mother and her two children at the end of October. They had plunged down the cliff in their VW Caravelle. Three Nelson Mandela Bay University students also died in the early hours on November 15, 2015 after their Toyota bakkie plunged down the cliff after leaving a gravel road. Southern Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Chris Spies said on Wednesday a member of the public had informed police of the incident at around 9.45pm yesterday. "They saw the car plunging down the cliff still with its lights on. The car had a CAW (George) registration." The victim is believed to be a woman in her fifties. Spies said the woman's body was recovered from the ocean this morning, but the wreckage is proving difficult to retrieve. Last month, police called off the search for the missing 6-year-old Cuzette Scheepers. The bodies of Cuzette's 2-year-old brother, Hugo, and her 35-year-old mother, Heidi, were found in the sea after they went missing on October 22. On October 24, Heidi's vehicle, a VW Caravelle, was found at the bottom of a cliff at Voëlklip beach. In 2015, only the bodies of 21-year-old Marnic Els and 22-year-old Luandro Jansen were found at Voëlklip beach, but the 20-year-old Werner Finger's body was never recovered. Cape Times
