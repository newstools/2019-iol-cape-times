The complaint from Horatio Huxham, 46, and Cindy, 40, relates to a placement of a 14-year-old boy last month. The pair claim the ACVV social worker failed to disclose criminal allegations against the boy. According to the Huxhams the boy was accused of rape, arson, housebreaking and assault. The couple subsequently took the child to the Melkbosstrand police and accused the ACVV of operating in bad faith The boy has since been moved to a different place of safety. Nicolette van der Walt, the ACVV national director, child protection, said: “The social worker did not have any prior knowledge, neither was there any record on the child’s file regarding the rape and arson allegations, except the burglary case he had against him and which his sister withdrew. “The ACVV has a long and good relationship with the Huxhams, and social workers have always explained everything regarding any child placed in their safe care.” She added: “Our regional manager, Aloise van der Merwe, had an appointment with them and discussed the situation and addressed their complaints.” The Huxham couple confirmed that Van der Merwe had visited them and informed them that the rape charge had been withdrawn because of the mental status of the 14-year-old boy, who could therefore not stand trial. “We are meeting with them at the ACVV Koeberg office tomorrow,” the couple said. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
