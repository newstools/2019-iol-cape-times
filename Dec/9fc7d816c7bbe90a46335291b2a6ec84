The allegations sparked violent student protests at CPUT campuses between 2014 and 2017 . Chaired by Judge James Yekiso and advocate Willem Heath, the commission began its work in March last year, and it was anticipated that it would submit its final report to the university council by July 31 that year. But that did not happen, and some of the parties who made submissions before the commission complained to the Department of Higher Education about the delay. It was then established that the high court had ruled that individuals implicated in the report had to be given the right of reply before it was released. In October this year, the commission sent a communiqué to the university community informing them that it had completed its work on September 27. The report was recently handed over to the council to decide what should happen next. University spokesperson Lauren Kansley said at the time that the findings and recommendations would be tabled at a council meeting, which was scheduled to have taken place last month. Yesterday, she said: “The Yekiso Commission’s report is being dealt with by the council, who are considering its findings.” Cape Times
