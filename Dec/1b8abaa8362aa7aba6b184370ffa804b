“The archbishop spent six days in hospital undergoing treatment for a recurring infection,” it said. The Nobel Peace Prize winner, 88, was admitted to hospital last Wednesday for what his wife Leah had said was a “stubborn infection”, a similar condition which has seen him admitted to hospital over the past few years. The foundation’s chairperson Niclas Kjellström-Matseke said on Sunday that the family hoped he would be discharged from hospital early in the week. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba paid him a visit in hospital and informed the parishioners that he found him “lucid and engaging”. “He was as good as he can be for an 88-year-old, especially in view of his ill-health in childhood,” Makgoba said. Tutu became renowned as a peace-builder in South Africa, and chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He has also been a vocal critic of the ANC over its handling of corruption scandals under the presidency of Jacob Zuma. Many had extended their well-wishes to the Tutus since they first heard the news. Makgoba said: "Please pray for him, for Mama Leah, for Trevor, Thandi, Nontombi and Mpho and their familes, and for the doctors treating him." Leonie Brooks: "Praying for Archbishop Tutu’s complete healing." Carla Lee McLachlan: "Get well soon Arch! Many blessings and love being sent to you." Kjellström-Matseke said the family wished to express its enormous gratitude to all who had sent love and prayers. Cape Argus
