The demonstration in the CBD, during which refugee leader Jean-Pierre Bacous highlighted grievances and demands, was also in support of International Migrants Day, marked yesterday. Speaking from the Central Methodist Mission’s steps, Bacous said they felt they would one day have to return to their countries of origin. “It takes a refugee to understand the pain we’re going through. The world must come and rescue us before it is too late. ‘‘No one is coming to our aid,” said Bacous, who accused the world of being hypocrites and closing their eyes and ears to the plight of refugees. “We are left in limbo where we don’t know what to do,” he said. Bacous bemoaned the ongoing court case the City brought against refugees, saying it was to get them to vacate the area around the church and the CBD. He also mentioned the refugees’ support for the three-day Global Refugee Forum being co-hosted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and Switzerland, and co-convened by Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan, and Turkey. The forum brings together refugees, heads of state and government, UN leaders, business leaders, international institutions, development organisations and civil society leaders.
