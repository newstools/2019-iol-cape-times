The City is expecting beaches to fill up, especially popular sites like Camps Bay, Muizenberg, Strandfontein, Monwabisi, Mnandi, Strand and Gordon’s Bay. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith has urged beachgoers to take precautionary measures for their own safety and that of others. “We have maximum deployment of law enforcement and SAPS at beaches which will be operational 24/7 over New Year’s Eve. “We urge parents and guardians to keep a lookout for their children on the day, they should register them for armbands,” Smith said. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring has advised beachgoers not to drink and drive and to be beware of fireworks. “No matter what activity you might be partaking in, make sure that you stay hydrated. “During the celebrations, there may be individuals that may take advantage of situations. Make sure that your cellphone is fully charged, that you travel in crowds, never accept drinks from strangers and never leave your drink unattended,” Meiring said. Cape Times
