A curious canine escaped serious injury after being rescued from under a huge boulder in Simon’s Town. The rescue saw a number of agencies head out to the town after residents called about the trapped dog, named Simon. Cape Medical Response, which headed the rescue, found the dog tightly wedged under rocks. “Upon arrival the dog, Simon, was found about 3m deep under a very large boulder. He had been chasing a dassie when he wiggled himself into the crevice and was not able to free himself,” said the organisation. Darren Zimmerman requested assistance from NSRI Station 10 Simon’s Town, Simon’s Town Fire & Rescue, TEARS Animal Rescue and Cape of Good Hope SPCA. “Simon was able to be hooked by his collar using a ceiling hook from the fire department and a dog-catching device from the SPCA, to bring him closer to the responders. “They managed to manoeuvre Simon out of his entrapment.” He added that Simon was trapped for about an hour and suffered a bit of a fright and dirty paws. CoGH SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said Simon was returned to his owners shortly afterwards. CAPE TIMES
