However, hundreds of thousands of people will need sustained support over the coming months. Our Disaster Response operations are led by the Mozambique Red Cross with support from IFRC and other partners, and have already helped more than 38000 survivors since Cyclone Idai made landfall. Our staff and volunteers distributed emergency relief supplies to more than 20 000 people, 900 people have been treated at Red Cross field hospitals and clinics, and more than 250 000 litres of clean water have been made available. The South African Red Cross Society thanks all donors for the overwhelming response to our last appeal, and has partnered with government, business, media houses and NGOs to deliver the donated items to affected communities. Please continue to support our relief and recovery efforts. Bank details: Standard Bank. Account Name: South African Red Cross Society. Account Number: 001355929. Branch code: 051001.
