Cape Town - FollowingÂ the announcement made by Mayor Dan Plato during his inauguration in November last year, that safety would be prioritised, the Cape Town CBD on Monday saw 18 new law enforcement officers on its streets. The deployment is in addition to the R165 million that was made available to increase law enforcement efforts, with an addition of 100 law enforcement officers being recruited, along with new CCTV cameras and patrol vehicles being deployed across the Cape Metro. Plato said they had noted concerns about safety within the CBD and "we want people to feel safer." "What you see today is part of our direct attempts to address crime and will hopefully result in an improvement in responding to incidents of crime in the CBD," Plato said. The officers will also be deployed in gang-ridden areas such as Bonteheuwel, Bishop Lavis and Valhalla Park. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
