The Transnet National Ports Authority said the cruise season came to a “magnificent close” in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, with the state-of-the-art Viking Sun calling at East London, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. This was the vessel’s maiden voyage to the country and the first time its Switzerland-based owner, Viking Ocean Cruises, had included South Africa on its global itinerary. Flying the flag of Norway, Viking Sun first arrived in Durban on April12. It was welcomed by the port’s management team and harbour master Kgadi Matlala, who presented a plaque to the ship’s master, Captain Olav Soevdsnes, in East London on April 15. The ship called at Port Elizabeth the following day and Cape Town on April 18, where a plaque exchange ceremony and cultural show took place on board. Cape Town had two passenger liners in port as its season ended, with Silversea Cruises’ Silver Whisper berthed alongside Viking Sun. Transnet Cape Town port manager Mpumi Dweba-Kwetana said: “As the Port of Cape Town, we are proud to be attracting growing numbers of tourists to our beautiful city. “Through the V&A Waterfront, our port is developing a world-class passenger terminal that will continue to gain the attention of leading cruise line companies like Viking Ocean Cruises.” Cape Times
