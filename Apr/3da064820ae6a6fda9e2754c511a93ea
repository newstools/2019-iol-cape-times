It took five hours to extinguish the fire, of which the cause is still unknown, said municipal manager Hanlie Linde. It is suspected that the fire started in the church’s tower. “The nearest fire station is in Piketberg (66.3km away). The West Coast district municipality’s fire and rescue services, Redelinghuys police, the Berg River’s fire and rescue services and law enforcement were present.” No one was injured. Executive director of the Rural and Farmworkers Development Organisation Billy Claasen said: “The church is totally demolished and also the property inside. “Apparently, it is damaged to the value of R30 million. “Also the cellphone signal has been interrupted, as the senders were in the church tower. “For the whole day, Redelinghuys will be without telephone reception,” Claasen added.
