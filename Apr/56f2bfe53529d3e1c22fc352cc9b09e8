The 11 students who make up the team plan to assist students with mental health illnesses via their confidential online student support platform, SUNLine. It will be operated by trained volunteers. Team member Melt Hugo said: “Statistics indicate that suicide is now the second leading cause of death among university students. “Families are forever torn apart and changed by their members who lose their fight to depression. A recent global study by the World Health Organisation (in which Stellenbosch University participated) found that one in every three first-year students arrive on campus with an already diagnosable mental health illness. Considering that South Africa ranks in the top 10 (of countries with the) highest rates of suicidewe are faced with a crisis and sitting on a time bomb.” The #SUpport campaign had received backing from all students. “Students can get involved by starting the conversation around mental health, educating themselves on the signs of depression and familiarising themselves with support structures,” he said. The university has become increasingly involved with initiatives to gain support for students with mental health difficulties. To donate, contact Hugo on 0795084381 or via melthugo@sun.ac.za.
