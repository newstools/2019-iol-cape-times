Cape Town – The Shark Spotters team will be off-duty on Saturday as they will be attending the funeral service for one of their fallen colleagues. The City of Cape Town informed beachgoers on Friday that the bathing spots that will be affected are The Hoek at Noordhoek, Glencairn, Fish Hoek, Clovelly, St James, Kalk Bay, Muizenberg, Monwabisi and Caves at Kogel Bay. The Shark Spotters will be back on duty on Sunday. "The City has approved the request to suspend the Shark Spotters’ services for the day to attend the funeral of their colleague who passed away last week. "We believe this will give them an opportunity to pay their last respects and thereby find a measure of closure," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Spatial Planning and Environment, Marian Nieuwoudt. "As a safe city, the safety of beach-goers, residents and visitors is our priority, hence we appeal to everyone using the beach area to be extra vigilant tomorrow. Residents and visitors who plan to visit the beach tomorrow are reminded that the Shark Spotters." The information centre at Surfers Corner Beach in Muizenberg will also not be open to members of the public for the day. Cape Times
