Cape Town – A man has been shot dead in Bonteheuwel in an alleged gang-related incident. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident, which took place at 8.15pm on Wednesday on the corner of Bonteheuwel Avenue and Swartysterhout Street. The murder of the 24-year-old Junaid Petersen, who is believed to have been affiliated to a gang, brings to 21 the number of murders in this area on the Cape Flats since the start of the year. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie told EWN: “We had relentless shootings in Bonteheuwel. For about 20 minutes flat it was completely terrifying, the number of shots that went out. “The poor residents were calling and running around trying to get their children to safety and trying to call the police but there was no response whatsoever.” In another incident in the vicinity of Bonteheuwel, a 43-year-old man was arrested in Netreg, Bishop Lavis, after an arsenal of bullets for a variety of firearms and more than 1 000 mandrax tablets were seized, Traut said. The man will appear in court once he has been charged. Cape Times
