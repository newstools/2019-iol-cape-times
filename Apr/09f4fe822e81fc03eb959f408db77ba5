Cape Town - Silulo Ulutho Technologies founder and managing director Luvuyo Rani has detailed how his employees in Nomzamo, Strand, had to run for their lives after a group of gunmen torched a franchise branch store to “clean it up”. The store employed about six people, had 85 students and served more than three Strand communities. It was among the business severely attacked during a violent protest last week. At least 37 people appeared at Strand Magistrate’s Court on public violence charges. The area turned into a no-go zone, with roads closed, as more than 1000 residents took to the streets after shacks were demolished. The protesters were demanding that the City purchase a piece of privately-owned land near the N2, close to Reddam House School. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said on day that their officers and other law enforcement agencies were on the ground and would remain there until law and order was restored. “The perpetrators broke the glass at the store and broke the locks. They looted 40 computers and the facilities were vandalised on Wednesday night. On hearing the store was damaged and set alight, the manager and the workers returned to the store on Thursday to look at the amount of damage. “While they were there, armed men stormed in and they ran for the door. Luckily no one was hurt. The business has been growing so well and changing many lives. The community needs our services, as we provide computer training and skills. We had classes from Monday to Friday for pupils, and most of the 85 students are a mixture of youth and adults,” Rani said. Nomzamo ward councillor Sitembile Mfecane said: “This is a setback for small business and a bad reputation for our community, all due to a number of selfish people. They are killing entrepreneurs, the same people they need. Tomorrow community leaders and city authorities will meet.” Cape Times
