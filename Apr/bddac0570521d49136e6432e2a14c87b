As the province and the country experienced a wave of violent protests relating to an array of issues, the CPF said, in its area, children and youths were at the forefront of burning tyres and stoning cars. CPF spokesperson Philip Bam said that on Friday children, still wearing school uniforms, had carried tyres to be burnt in the street. “Youngsters started fires and attempted to damage the traffic lights. These were not people looking for housing. These were hooligans out to take advantage and cause damage. "Children in school uniforms were wheeling tyres to be burnt in the street. "The Grassy Park CPF calls on parents to exercise control over their children. Children should not be allowed to put themselves in harm's way,” Bam said. The city has been rocked by about 121 service delivery protests over the past three months, with protests in Strand and Khayelitsha being the latest. CAPE TIMES
