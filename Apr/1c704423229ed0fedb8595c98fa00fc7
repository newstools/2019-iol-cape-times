Cape Town – A former Grade 9 Sans Souci Girls' High pupil's assault case was postponed to May after she appeared briefly in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court in camera on Monday. The 16-year-old made her second appearance over the physical altercation she was involved in with a teacher in February, EWN reported. Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed that the case was postponed until May 2. Afrikaans teacher Clarissa Venter, who is due to return to school today after her suspension, and the pupil's mother had laid counter-charges. The pupil left the school before her hearing took place, while the school governing body gave Venter, who could be seen slapping the pupil in a video that went viral after she had been shoved, a final warning, fined her and ordered her to attend counselling sessions. Netwerk24 reported that Ashraf Mohamed, who represented the pupil at her first court appearance, confirmed that he had withdrawn from the case. She is now represented by Kailash Raman Patel from Patel Petersen Attorneys. A claim has been lodged in the Equality Court for damages amounting to R150 000 by the pupil's mother over alleged racism. Attorney William Booth, who acts on behalf of Venter, 34, said his office had filed opposing papers objecting to the claim. Cape Times
