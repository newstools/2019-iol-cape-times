The City said use of seasonal firefighters was one of a number of interventions introduced by the Fire and Rescue Service to help navigate the management of fires in the warmer months, which are generally characterised by an increase in vegetation fires in Cape Town. “Vegetation fires account for more than two-thirds of the incidents that our firefighters have to contend with annually. The situation becomes particularly tricky during summer when we have an increase in vegetation fires. Our seasonal firefighters are specifically trained for this type of incident We thank them for their contribution to public safety in Cape Town,” said mayor Dan Plato. Of the 114 seasonal firefighters who were originally recruited for the 2018/19 season, 15 secured learnership posts with the Fire and Rescue Service. They are currently completing their eight-month training course. Ten others retired from the programme during the season. CAPE TIMES
