This will form part of the Cansa TLC programme at Tygerberg Children’s Hospital. It focuses on raising awareness of cancers affecting children and teens, and the importance of early detection. August-Reynecke aims at running a 21km race on Saturday. She said: "A contribution of as little as R10 towards the 1km or R210 towards the 21km that I will be covering on Saturday will be welcome. "No matter how big or small you think your support is, every bit helps me get closer to reaching my goal.” She is a founder of Birthday of Hope, a community initiative established in 2012 that focuses on making a change in the lives of all their beneficiaries and restoring hope. “When you’ve lived through the loss of a loved one, there are so many lessons learnt along the way, and I’m a firm believer that we may not have the ability to change all the world’s wrongs, but we can make a difference where we are,” she said. Anyone wishing to donate can email augustc09@gmail.com or contact 0721350274. A number of temporary road closures will be in place to accommodate pre-event activities leading up to the race day. A detailed schedule of the road closures can be found at http://bit.do/RdClosures.
