Dr Ismail Bhorat, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and a subspecialist in foetal-maternal medicine, will today be awarded his second doctor of philosophy degree in health sciences. This will be the first PhD Senior degree awarded from the University of KZN. Bhorat received his first PhD in foetal medicine in 2015. “It is an honour for me to be awarded the PhD Senior and I hope to inspire others in this field,” he said. His thesis was the first study to look at integrating maternal and foetal cardiac function as a predictive tool in high-risk obstetric conditions. “The thesis explores ways to combine heart functional assessments in the mother and foetus in different high-risk pregnancy conditions that lead to scoring systems that clinicians can use to optimise and better predict when to deliver the baby,” he said. A pioneer in foetal surgery in South Africa, Bhorat has saved many babies who, but for his and his team’s interventions, would have died before being born. One of his procedures is believed to be the first of its kind in the world. CAPE TIMES
