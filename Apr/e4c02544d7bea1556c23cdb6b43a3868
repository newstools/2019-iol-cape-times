WOF is a government-funded job-creation programme that employs more than 5 000 needy young people. They are trained in fire awareness, fire prevention and fire suppression skills. WOF managing director Trevor Abrahams said the project supported the well-being of firefighters and their families. Last year WOF distributed about 1850 Kids Care Packages containing essential personal care products, school necessities and educational toys to children of WOF firefighters and high altitude team (Hat) rope technicians. “These children’s moms and dads - the WOF firefighters and Hat rope technicians - work long and dangerous hours, fighting unwanted wildfires. “They often sacrifice time with their families to go and save lives, properties and the environment in remote areas, late into the night.” Abrahams said that seeing the joy on the children’s faces inspired them to continue with the initiative. They decided to turn it into a golf day in hope of growing it. Cape Times
