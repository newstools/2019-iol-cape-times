Cape Town – A proponent of allowing the terminally ill to die through the legalisation of euthanasia, Professor Sean Davison now faces a third murder charge. Davison appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday for the 2013 assisted suicide of Anrich Burger, who became a quadriplegic following a car accident in 2005. He also faces charges relating to the the 2015 death of Justin Varian who had motor neuron disease. Yesterday it emerged Davison was charged with the death of a third person, sportsman Richard Holland, by administering a lethal amount of drugs to Holland. Born in New Zealand and known worldwide for helping his 85-year-old mother Pat to die following her battle with cancer, Davison, was arrested in September last year and was charged with premeditated murder. The case was postponed to May 24 when a date for the high court was expected to be set. Davison's bail of R20 000 was extended until then. Cape Times
