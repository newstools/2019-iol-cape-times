Cape Town – Alleged rapist cop Enkosi Matiwane appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday. The Grassy Park police officer allegedly raped a shoplifting suspect while she was in custody in 2016. He has been linked to the crime by his DNA after a three-year continuing investigation. Matiwane is set to appear in court again on May 31 for further investigation. Police are yet to confirm if the officer is still employed by SAPS following an interdisciplinary hearing. Previously, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the matter was being investigated and that the officer was still on active duty at the Grassy Park police station at the time of his first appearance on March 7. “This incident occurred in 2016. (A) departmental hearing took place. He is still working for the police,” Dlamini said. In March, a Hanover Park woman told the Daily Voice she is living in fear after reporting the Cape Flats cop who allegedly raped her in a holding cell. And she said while Constable Enkosi Matiwane from Grassy Park police station walks around a free man after being granted bail, she has been left traumatised. The 29-year-old woman says she has been living like a prisoner in her own home after her alleged rapist came to her house three times. Cape Times
