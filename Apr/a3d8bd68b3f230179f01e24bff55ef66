The 14-year-old was last seen on Sunday afternoon by her aunt Kashiefa Fakir and her siblings leaving their Olive Street, Eastridge, home to go to a nearby shop. At the time of her disappearance she was wearing a black long-sleeve top, blue denim pants and black sleeping shoes. Mumtaaz is about 1.5m tall, weighs about 45kg, has light skin with dark brown eyes and brown, shoulder-length hair. “We were all in the house at about 2pm when Mumtaaz informed me she wanted to buy something at the shop. The store is just a few houses away from us so when she was taking a long time I asked her younger brother to check why she was taking so long. "I was surprised when he returned without her, saying she was not there. I thought maybe she had met a friend,” Fakir said. Fakir and her mother Faldiela are Mumtaaz’s legal guardians.
