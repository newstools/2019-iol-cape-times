Mario Kline said the assailants appeared from nowhere, pointing what looked like authentic guns, and took charge of his work truck. “Everything happened fast. One came on my side and others entered at the passenger side, and they forcefully pushed me into the middle. “I was so scared, I thought I was going to die - seeing all the guns pointed at me - and I decided to wrestle with the one driving and took his gun. “When I saw the guns were toys, I kicked the other two,” he said. While the scuffle went on, the thug who was driving lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a pole on the corner of Longmarket and St George’s Mall streets. Onlookers came to his rescue but the two other assailants managed to escape. The accomplice was apprehended by Central City Improvement District security officers, and police arrived a few minutes after. Okuhle Hlati
