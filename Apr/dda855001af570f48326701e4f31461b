According to the police Mahilihili is on the run. He is wanted in connection with the rape of a 20-year-old female student at a Bellville campus on April 28 last year. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said a warrant for the suspect’s arrest was issued. Known as Propaganda, Mahilihili was among the #FeesMustFall movement activists arrested at CPUT in 2016. The charges against him were, however, withdrawn in September 2018. “Sapho Mahilihili is well known to campus security and is not allowed on the premises of any CPUT campus. “Mahilihili is not a CPUT student and therefore any criminal charges which may be pending against him are for the SAPS to pursue. “In incidents of rape, a standard protocol exists which includes reporting to campus protection services for investigation. “Campus health, student counselling and the local Thuthuzela care centre services also assist,” CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said. Anyone with information of his whereabouts can anonymously contact detective Dale Franks at 0721454163 or 0219183689, alternatively Crime Stop at 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. CAPE TIMES
