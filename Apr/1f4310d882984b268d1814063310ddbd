This came after the George Municipality left the Uncedo Service Taxi Association and the Taxi Commuter Forum (TCF) out in the cold following their decision not to support the implementation of Phase 4A of the GIPTN. Uncedo and TCF represent the taxi operators and Thembalethu communities where the roll-out of Phase 4A of the project was to be implemented before Phase 4B, as per the original plan. “The support of the taxi operators and the commuter forum that are likely to be affected by the roll-out of the IPTN in particular, and the community in general, is critical for the successful roll-out of the systems,” Nzimande said. He said that skipping Phase 4A of the GIPTN project that would serve the communities and proceeding to the next phase areas, that included Parkdene, Borcherds, Conville, Lawaaikamp, and Ballotsview, would not only cause divisions between the communities, but would further delay the project’s implementation. Transport MEC Donald Grant said: “It’s critical to note that this is a question of service delivery, and the community engagement in George has been clear that the GO GEORGE bus services must be extended to provide citizens and residents with better services.” CAPE TIMES
