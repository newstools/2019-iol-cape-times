Cape Town – The much-needed rainfall in Beaufort-West has not been enough to break the drought the town is experiencing. According to the Central Karoo District Municipality, rainfall of up 18 millimetres has been recorded in some parts of the drought-stricken Karoo town over the last few days, proving much-needed relief. The municipality's head of disaster risk management, Hein Rust, says rainfall of up 75 millimetres has also been recorded in some high mountainous areas in the Karoo, the SABC reported. "Down to the towns, the rain was less. Like in Beaufort-West we had between 14 and 18 millimetres of rain, but at least there will be water in the Gamka Dam near Beaufort-West. It might be in the vicinity of up to 30 percent full." SANParks has warned that all routes in the Karoo National Park outside Beaufort West have been closed until further notice due to the wet conditions throughout the park. More than 50mm of rain has been recorded in the Mountain View area of the park. Since the beginning of the year, residents in high-lying areas of Beaufort West have had to contend with emergency water rations of 10 litres as well as three rounds of "water shedding" a day.
