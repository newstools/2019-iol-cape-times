I believe that it would be an interesting story for the Cape Times to investigate and to let their readers know about the current changes to Cape Town City Ballet. Cape Town City Ballet has been one of the hallmarks of Cape Town and is truly a great attraction to our city. We are one of the few cities left in Africa that have an official ballet company and we need to not only be proud of it but protect it against any possible internal implosion. Although sport and modern music concerts seem to have taken up most of the “air space”, I strongly believe that a cultured city needs the trio of orchestra, opera and ballet. These three disciplines would attract entrepreneurs from all over the globe to settle in Cape Town and invest in our beautiful city. Michael Bagraim Highlands Estate
