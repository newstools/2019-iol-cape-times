A fire gutted two classrooms and damaged a third at the school last month. The SGB took to social media to say the provincial education department neither provided a safety and clearance report for asbestos prevalence nor demolished the damaged part of the building. “The school governing body decided to officially close the school after the education department failed to provide us with the safety certificate of the accredited body that tests asbestos. They also failed to demolish the burned section,” they said. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said an air test was conducted yesterday morning and the results were provided to the SGB. “The SGB refused to open the gates of the school. They expressed concern over the effects of asbestos on their children. “A fire recently damaged a part of the building which has subsequently been removed. “They are satisfied with the feedback and have agreed that the school will reopen,” Hammond said.
