That was Lara van Rooyen’s reacted, after being accepted to study at Harvard University for the next academic year. She scored a 92.86% average to secure joint honours as Curro Holdings’s IEB top academic achiever of 2018. She is one of only 1950 students accepted into Harvard College, the undergraduate programme of Harvard University for the year. Starting in August, she hopes to major in biology or biochemistry, after which she will either be going to medical school or become a research scientist. “Realistically, I didn't think there was a chance at all that I would get accepted,” Van Rooyen said. After completing her application, she had to attend an interview in Cape Town, which lasted for three hours. When she eventually heard about her acceptance into Harvard at the start of April, it was with much relief. Van Rooyen’s journey to Harvard is seen as an inspiration for others. Her advice for other learners was: “Just because you come from a small town or go to a small school, it does not mean your dreams need to be small.” CAPE TIMES
