Cape Town – Cape Town International Airport experienced a power failure just before sunset on Wednesday due to a fault which occurred at the Belhar substation. It was without power for about 46 minutes but luckily the airport's operations were only minimally impacted as their back-up supply kicked in. The power utility said in a statement: "Eskom customers in the areas of Belhar, Elsies River, Matroosfontein, Bishop Lavis and Airport Industrial, including the Cape Town International Airport, were without electricity supply for a period of about 46 minutes this evening due to a fault which occurred at the Belhar substation. "Eskom had just completed refurbishment work at the Belhar substation when a fault on the 132kV network caused a supply loss at 17h33. "All supply to the affected areas was returned by 18h19. An investigation has been launched into the root cause of the incident. "With regards to the airport, Eskom was informed that the airport's operations were minimally impacted as their back-up supply kicked in effectively. Eskom apologises for any inconvenience caused to the customers who were affected."
