A packed programme for the 22 contestants includes workshops, photo shoots, cultural tours and the main events. Contenders come from as far as Venezuela, Thailand, Spain and Ireland Chris Emmanuel represents South Africa. As an icebreaker, organisers have arranged for the entourage to participate in a team-building day in Khayelitsha today. Chairperson of the competition’s board of directors, Igor Scheurkogel, wished the contenders luck, saying: “As a South African I’m so proud to host the world again for the 11th Mr Gay World finale in Cape Town. We’ve shown growth from 2018. “The LGBTIQ+ community worldwide has faced an increasing amount of discrimination and hate crimes which make MGW an organisation and event that’s needed more than ever, to unite our community and raise awareness of the challenges we face.” A VIP dinner will take place on Friday at 6.30pm at the President Hotel, and the finale will be on Saturday at 6pm at the Cape Town City Hall.
