Traffic services spokesperson Richard Coleman said: "Wimbledon Road is closed between Range and Buttskop due to protestors burning tyres. Saps, Metro Police and Traffic are on the scene. Law Enforcement en-route. MyCity staff at (Transport Management Centre) are aware and are communicating with their drivers," said Coleman. A Khayelitsha MyCiti bus commuter who asked not to be named said: "We were forced to find alternative transport. Only one bus came when I was there and was already full, but some pushed their way in. This caused a lot of inconvenience to many as this happened during the peak hour."  CAPE TIMES
