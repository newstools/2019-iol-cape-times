Cape Town – The MyCiTi bus blaze that caused traffic havoc from just before 5pm on Thursday on the N2 at Hospital Bend has been contained. This took place less than three hours after a Golden Arrow bus was destroyed in a fire as it waited to load passengers at the CBD terminus next to Golden Acre. No one was injured. Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse confirmed at 6.02pm that the MyCiTi bus fire had been contained after two fire engines, a rescue vehicle and 12 staff members had to be deployed. The firefighters had to use two fog jets to help contain the fire. No injuries were reported. City of Cape Town mayoral committee member JP Smith told TimesLIVE the MyCiTi fire started in the engine compartment of the bus as it climbed Hospital Bend shortly before 5pm and quickly engulfed the vehicle. He said the bus had no passengers onboard, and the driver had stopped in the middle lane and escaped. Traffic on the N2 had to be diverted onto the M3 outgoing. The Golden Arrow bus caught fire around 2.20pm and a company spokesperson said while the cause of the blaze was still not known there was no reason to suspect arson. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said: "At this stage the cause of the fire is unknown but it does not appear to be related to vandalism. We will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause." Cape Times
