Cape Town – A 6-year-old girl has been shot and wounded after being hit by a stray bullet during a gang fight in Avian Park in Worcester. The girl was shot in the head on Monday afternoon while on her way home from pre-school in a nearby suburb, River View, and was caught in the crossfire, police said. When officers arrived on the scene, residents pelted them with stones and a police sergeant was injured, police spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk said on Tuesday. Van Wyk said four gang members were arrested for attempted murder, the possession of a firearm and the pointing of a firearm, and are expected to appear in the Worcester Magistrate's Court soon. "Further investigation on the scene revealed that a 6-year-old girl child was shot in the head in Avian Park while she was being transported in a Hyundai mini truck from a pre-primary school in River View. "The victim was airlifted by medical personnel to a hospital in Cape Town for medical treatment. A heavy police contingent was deployed to maintain law and order in the area, which also led to the arrest of four suspects aged between 18 and 29. A handmade firearm was also confiscated." Cape Times
