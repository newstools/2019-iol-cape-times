The NSPCA in March held a special general meeting to determine the future of the Kriel SPCA. According to the NSPCA, the meeting was poorly attended by the community and the decision was made to close the SPCA. “We had hoped that members of the community would come forward to not only support the society, but to take ownership of the Kriel SPCA and serve on the management committee. “Unfortunately, not a single member of the community came forward, which left us with no option but to de-register the Kriel SPCA,” said the NSPCA’s liaison unit manager Jaco Pieterse. The NSPCA said that all SPCAs around the country depended on local communities to survive, and this was not only from a financial perspective but also from a management perspective. Without that support, the SPCAs would not survive. “The SPCA plays a vital role in all communities, from the protection of animals to the protection of society as a whole. Without the SPCAs, our country would be in a worse state than it already is - we implore the communities around the country to support their local SPCAs to ensure their survival.” CAPE TIMES
