Pretoria â€“ The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has launched an investigation into the deaths of two people during service delivery protests in Caledon in the Overberg. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed on Wednesday that the matter has been reported to Ipid for an independent probe. A Western Cape ANC source told News24 that he had received information that the protesters had been shot by police, but could not confirm this as fact. Another source said that the two protesters died during a stampede after police fired rubber bullets. Initially, a number of roads in the area were closed in the morning due to the protests but has since been reopened, the SABC reported. Western Cape MEC Alan Winde has appealed for calm, saying it is alleged that there are political parties who are at the forefront of the protests. Dennis Cruywagen, of the Western Cape ANC, who had travelled to the scene, told News24 that according to witnesses he had spoken to, police fired live rounds at the protesters and that the two deceased protesters were killed during a stampede that followed. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said: "Once we have interviewed witnesses, we'll be able to determine what happened."     Cape Times
