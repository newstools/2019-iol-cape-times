"We will always love you and miss you. Till we meet again, your parents Alric and Carol.” Describing the incident, bystander Shaamiela Adams said: “Heartbreaking experience we had, meeting the family of the young man who lost his life while running in the Two Oceans Marathon, just 5km before the finish line. He collapsed in front of us, and we tried to help him but God needed him more. “What an experience to see how quickly one’s life can end. I pray that The Almighty place healing hands over the family during this time of bereavement.” Van Niekerk grew up in Wynberg and attended Norman Henshilwood High School.
