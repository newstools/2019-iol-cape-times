Sizwe Biyela, Nkosinathi Khumalo and Vuyile Maliti were set to make a bail application yesterday, but proceedings were halted when State prosecutor Helene Booysen said no interpreter in Cape Town was available to translate for the accused. Previously, the men were remanded to different prisons as they faced a security risk at Pollsmoor Prison, according to the State. Biyela was remanded to Malmesbury Prison, while Khumalo remains in custody at Allandale. Maliti was remanded to Drakenstein. Biyela and Khumalo were arrested shortly after Mihalik was killed while dropping his son off at Reddam House School last October 30. Mihalik’s son, 8, was injured after a bullet lodged in his face. Following suit of their previous appearances, the three appeared in a heavily guarded courtroom while the Anti-Gang Unit, who are heading up the investigation in the murder case, swept the courtroom before proceedings. They maintained a strong presence throughout the suspects’ appearance. Booysen said the State might add further charges following further investigation. Cape Times
