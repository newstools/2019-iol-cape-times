Carol was filled with integrity and we'll miss her. Our deep condolences to her family.” DAFF spokesperson Khaye Nkwanyana said: “The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is deeply saddened by the news of her passing. “She was a distinguished communicator for our fisheries component in the department based in the Western Cape.

"From ICU she went to the normal ward but the situation did not improve.This week things really deteriorated until she passed.” Moses is survived by her husband, Clive Stuurman, and their child Che.
