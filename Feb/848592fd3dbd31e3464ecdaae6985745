Cape Town – The recent rainfall in the Karoo has not been sufficient to break the drought, says Local Government MEC Anton Bredell. “In December Beaufort West usually gets about 28mm of rain and in January it is about 20mm every year. This past December the town got 0mm in December and 2mm in January. "The province remains in the area on a full-time basis being assisted with drought alleviation projects,” he said. “Overall, the Karoo region remains extremely dry but other areas are also seeing dam levels running low at the beginning of autumn. We are headed to winter and we hope for good rainfall in the coming months.” Bredell urged consumers to continue to use water responsibly, even in areas where there may be no water challenges. He also urged farmers and farmworkers in drought-affected areas to contact the provincial government or other stakeholders for assistance. “The burden of drought is a terrible one to bear alone; the province has measures in place that may be of help.” The dams that supply the City of Cape Town with water have an average level of 56.8%, compared to  24.5% at the same time last year. The average dam level in the province sits currently at 45.07%, compared to 22.6% last year. The city's main supply dam, Theewaterskloof, is currently at 44.1% (2018: 11.7%); Voëlvlei Dam at 71.5% (2018: 17.3%); Berg River dam at 78.8% (2018: 52.3%); and Clanwilliam Dam is 46.3% (2018: 13.1%).
