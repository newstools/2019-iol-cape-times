Cape Town – Traffic officers have arrested 106 suspects in the last week and issued 3 384 fines for various other offences. Of those arrested, 78 were caught driving under the influence, 25 had outstanding warrants and the rest were caught for reckless and negligent driving, defeating the ends of justice and fraud, the City of Cape Town said on Monday. Some of the key operations included 15 arrests at a roadblock in Mowbray/Rondebosch; 14 arrests during a drag racing operation in Table View; and 20 arrests at a roadblock in Lingelethu West. "Meanwhile, the challenge with public transport operators who drive while impaired continues. In one of the latest incidents, the Drink Driving Awareness/RTB Unit arrested a driver for one of the e-hailing services in Bellville this morning. "His breathalyser result was 0.74 mg/L which is more than three times the legal breath alcohol limit. "Cape Town Traffic will continue acting against people who disregard the law, whether driving under the influence or failure to pay their outstanding fines. "Motorists are reminded that the City has numerous options available to them to settle outstanding fines – even those that have reached warrant stage." Cape Times
