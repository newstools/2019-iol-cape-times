The Angels Resource Centre (“Angels”) launched The Big Waste Wake Up programme using crowdfunding platform BackABuddy. Valentine’s buy-back centre is on Lekkerwater Road in Sunnydale, outside Masiphumelele. She is among the 20 Masiphumelele survivalist entrepreneurs collecting recyclables. The Angels Resource Centre has trained and mentored entrepreneurs in recycling via its Big Wake-Up programme. It was launched in 2007 and currently runs in under-resourced towns across the Northern and Western Cape. The programme provides training and mentorship to Valentine in business administration, helping her to improve her business. Fund-raising organisers aim to raise R15 000 for Valentine’s business to cut collection costs and compact waste into easily transportable blocks. The Big Waste Wake Up will also help her with equipment that enables her to utilise the facility's space more efficiently. Valentine’s business has created a way for individuals to earn income while cleaning up their environments. Her business collects the waste and takes it to the depot, where it is weighed and a rate paid out per kilogram.
