Cape Town – It's all systems go for the official opening of Parliament on Thursday as President Cyril Ramaphosa, ministers, MPs and the public descend on the CBD for the State of the Nation address (Sona). Official rehearsals took place on Tuesday and Wednesday and the national government and the police had requested road closures be effected in the city, which will extend from 6am until 23.45pm on Thursday in some parts. The road closures will affect the normal flow of traffic in and around the City Bowl, Newlands, the M3 and N2 city-bound lanes. The City said security fencing will line the route in the CBD and there will be guarded pedestrian crossing points during peak time on Plein Street (Shortmarket, Spin and Barrack streets). Pedestrians have been encouraged to make use of Buitenkant Street. The Company’s Gardens will be closed on Thursday from 6am to 23.45pm, while Darling Street between Adderley and Buitenkant streets, and Wale Street between Adderley and Queen Victoria streets, may be closed during the day for security reasons. Contingency closures in case of an emergency may include Adderley Street between Strand and Bureau streets; Longmarket Street between Buitenkant and Long streets; Church Street between Burg and Adderley streets; and Burg Street between Wale and Longmarket streets. The City said its emergency and enforcement services will also be on duty. Alternative routes into the city ahead of SONA 2019: The city may be forced to grind to a halt, but that does not mean ordinary people have the luxury of doing the same. Commuters still need to weave their way in and out of the Mother City, regardless of what political shenanigans are taking place across town.
