Cape Town – Alleged gangsters are taking advantage of load shedding by shooting at their rivals under the cover of darkness. Bishop Lavis SAPS said they are investigating a shooting in which three people were injured during load shedding in Bonteheuwel on Tuesday evening. The two males and a female were sitting inside a dark wendy house in a backyard when gunmen fired through the window. It is believed that there was more than one shooter and it is yet to be confirmed if the matter is gang-related. The 20-year-old woman was shot in her knee, a 23-year-old man was shot twice in the head and right arm, and another man was shot in the left hip. All three victims survived the attack and were taken to Vanguard Day Hospital for treatment.
