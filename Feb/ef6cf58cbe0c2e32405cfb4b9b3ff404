Speaking during his annual address to the National House of Traditional Leaders, Ramaphosa said: "We urge traditional leaders of our country to encourage all eligible voters to register and participate in these elections..." The national and provincial elections will be held on May 8, as announced by Ramaphosa during the state-of-the-nation address. The election date is yet to be gazetted.
