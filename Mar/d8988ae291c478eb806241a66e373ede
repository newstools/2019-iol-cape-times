Cape Town â€“ Two construction workers have died after being hit by a truck while setting out signs on the R60 between Robertson and Ashton. Just before midnight yesterday a truck plunged into a construction vehicle, Western Cape Traffic chief Kenny Africa said on Thursday. "A truck plunged into a construction vehicle and also killed two road workers on the road between Robertson and Ashton. The road is closed and motorists are asked to make use of alternative routes," Ashton said. The road has since been reopened. The road was closed for a lenghty period to enable emergency workers to attend to the incident and to clear the road of debris. Pictures taken at the scene showed a truck upside down and another on top of some of the equipment used for the roadworks. A long-term programme of road upgrades has been under way on routes in the region. Cape Times
