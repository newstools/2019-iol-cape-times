Notywala appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court yesterday, where the case was postponed to next month after court officials could not find his docket. Notywala was arrested after he was part of a group of about 50 peaceful protesters who gathered at the Civic Centre to highlight the social plight of Cape Town’s poorest residents. Notywala said he was released on a warning and the delays in the court proceedings meant a delay in his being able to participate in demonstrations. “It’s a frustrating process waiting for the court to act. I was released on a warning, and with it hanging over my head, I can’t participate in demonstrations we organise. Essentially I can’t do the work we do,” Notywala said. Notywala previously said he was charged with contravening sections 12 (g) and (j) of the Gatherings Act, which relate to “failure to comply with an order issued” and “hinders, interferes with, obstructs or resists a member of the police, responsible officer, convener, marshal or other person in the exercise of his powers or the performance of his duties”.
