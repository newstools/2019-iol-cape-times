Cape Town – A MyCiTi bus was stoned and ended up being the target of a failed petrol-bomb attack in Dunoon on Thursday night. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said a case of malicious damage to property is being investigated. The attack took place at around 20.50pm in Potsdam Road near the N7. The front windscreen and two side windows of the bus were smashed. Felicity Purchase, the city's mayoral committee member for transport, said: "The South African Police Service is investigating the incident and the outcome will hopefully shed some light on the motives. "The attacks on Cape Town’s public transport services are of great concern and should be condemned by all. "We have thousands of commuters who rely on public transport to get to work and school. They get up before dawn and get home late because of the long distances they have to travel and the delays that are often as a result of attacks, sabotage and theft." At the end of 2018, five MyCiTi buses were set alight and four damaged in the last two months, resulting in losses amounting to about R22 million. Last month, two people were arrested after two MyCiTi buses were stoned along Kloof Nek Road. Cape Times
