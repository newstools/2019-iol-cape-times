The Indigo Global Wellness Index, a new study published by an investment firm called LetterOne, placed South Africa at the bottom of the world’s health and happiness rankings. Of the 151 countries featured in the study, South Africa came last – particularly when it came to health. The risks measured by the index included healthy life expectancy, obesity, depression as well as tobacco and alcohol use. Canada was named the healthiest country followed by Oman, Iceland and the Philippines. This is the second negative report on the health of South Africans in recent months. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report ranked South Africa as the sixth drunkest country in the world. In 2016, WHO said that more than 28% of South Africans were obese, the highest obesity in sub-Saharan Africa. “No one cooks from scratch any more, we rely on highly processed food. The less stress you have, the more you are likely to take care of yourself. Now we are just trying to survive.” She said the government needed to play its role in ensuring that South Africans were encouraged to lead healthier lifestyles. Cape Times
