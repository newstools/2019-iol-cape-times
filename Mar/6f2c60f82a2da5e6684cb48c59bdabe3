The aim of the event is to show steadfast commitment to a better future to protecting nature. With the theme, #Connect2Earth, the Earth Hour - which started in 2007 in Australia - and is now a worldwide event where people switch off their lights. It started just as a way of saving energy but now is a symbolic switch-off when people are asked to think about their relationship with nature and their responsibility to Planet Earth. This yearâ€™s event will begin at 6pm in Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. Activities will see participants navigating their way by headlamps to hidden checkpoints dotted across a 5km course through the gardens. After all the action, everyone will be encouraged to spread a picnic blanket on the lawns while marking Earth Hour between 8.30pm and 9.30pm along with millions of people around the world. The tickets for the Earth Hour Adventure at Kirstenbosch are R180 for adults and R100 per child and available through Quicket at www.quicket.co.za/events/65797-earth-hour-adventure-2019/#/ Cape Times
