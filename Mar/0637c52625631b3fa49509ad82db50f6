Marcel Londt, head of social work at UWC, said the collaboration started in 2009 with a request from Howard University for an exchange programme with the Social Work Department. Each year in March, the collaboration is celebrated with an event open to various non-governmental organisations - from Bishop Lavis to Bishopscourt - to discuss a variety of social challenges and find the best way forward. “It became a regular shared space for talk and knowledge-sharing that encourages new research topics. “With our 10-year celebration, the focus is on improving human relationships on an international level. “This is an issue that is close to their hearts as well as ours,” Londt said. “I think this collaboration has shown that as social workers our role is not only to deliver and intervene, but it’s also about promoting relationships to help build this nation, and to contribute to the challenges that we face internationally.” One of the items featured on the agenda is research on the social dynamics of waste pickers by Professor Catherina Schenck. “Society often views these people in an inferior way and we often use very derogatory terms to describe them. “What we must realise is that they see themselves as self-sufficient and self-employed. I think society misses seeing their efforts in providing an income for their families.” Another interesting topic to be discussed is research by a UWC PhD student, Amanda Ismail, on the experiences of refugees in South Africa. “We are all about making a difference. We are graduating students who are going to look at (the needs of) all people in this country, and will work at making sure that the rights of every child in this country, whether a natural citizen or refugee, be embraced, according to the goals set out by the World Health Organisation,” added Londt.
