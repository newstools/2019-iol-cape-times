Cape Town – The Hawks are trying to track down three men suspected of buying luxury vehicles by allegedly using fake bank statements and salary slips in three separate cases. According to a Hawks statement, these "persons of interest... might assist in ongoing investigations into alleged vehicle finance fraudulent transactions committed in 2018, where Cape Town vehicle franchises allegedly incurred losses of almost R3 million". Two purchases, involving a 2013 BMW 435i and a 2016 Ford Ranger XLT, were allegedly made last year with the use of forged payslips and bank statements, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase. The purchases, in Goodwood and Kuils River, were worth a combined R1 million, he said. “The Hawks believe that Na-aim Saiet, 42, can positively contribute in these cases being solved. Anyone with information about Na-aim Saiet's whereabouts should contact the investigating officer, Sergeant Nomonde Potelwa, on 071 481 3184.”
