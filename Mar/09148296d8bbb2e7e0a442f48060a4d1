The council announced yesterday that it had opened applications for the 2019 project-funding cycle. This will be the NAC’s second round of funding with new programmes and applications utilising an online system following the entity's strategic realignment last year. Applicants can apply for funding within programmes such as social cohesion and nation building, innovation, design and creation of new work, capacity building, strategic initiatives as well as platforms, exhibitions and festivals. NAC interim chief executive Dr Sibongiseni Mkhize said: “At the NAC we are committed to changing the landscape of South Africa's creative industries. "Key to this transformation is not only supporting existing centres of excellence, but also identifying and fostering emerging talent nationwide." Successful applications will be announced on June 30 and funding guidelines are available on the NAC website at www.nac.org.za Cape Times
