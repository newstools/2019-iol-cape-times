Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo and senior officials from the department held a meeting with angry residents at the Thusong Centre/Gerald Wright Memorial Hall. An improvement strategy for health services in Grabouw was discussed with residents, which included services at Grabouw Community Day Centre and in the surrounding area. “We want to assure the residents in Grabouw that we are serious about delivering quality, person-centred health care, and that is why we are here in this community with all relevant role-players to discuss the improvement strategy. “We are fully aware of the challenges that patients experience at this facility, but I can assure the community that once this strategy is implemented, we will see improvement,” said Mbombo. Among the several interim solutions discussed was the current primary health-care service to be extended on weekdays from 7.30am to 7pm and on Saturdays until 1pm. The opening of the emergency services will include the appointment of extra staff, comprising of doctors, nurse practitioners and trauma personnel to ensure a 24-hour service and patient flow. Maternal services will also be improved. Cape Times
