The Chishty Sabiree Jahangiri Khanqa and Research Centre is hosting The International Sacred Trusts Exhibition across the country, which kicked off on February 22. Until 9pm tonight at the Masjidul Quds, also known as the Gatesville Mosque, the 15 relics which date back 1440 years, include a single strand of Prophet Muhammad’s hair, one of the Prophet’s sandals and a piece of cloak that smells of musk. Mosque chairperson Sataar Parker said it was an honour for the mosque to host the Cape Town leg of the exhibition. “We have had many high points in our history, and this is very high up on the list. It is an overwhelming experience,” Parker said. The relics are from the Jama Masjid of Delhi, one of the largest mosques in India. The mosque was commissioned in 1644 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal, for the sole purpose of housing the Prophet’s relics. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There is a similar exhibition in Topkapi in Istanbul, but not everyone is able to visit,” Parker said. Cape Times
