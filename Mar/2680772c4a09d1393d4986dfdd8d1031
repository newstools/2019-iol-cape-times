Eskom said even with the implementation of stage 4 load shedding at the weekend, the utility experienced a further decline in water reserves which were used to supplement generation capacity. “Eskom is currently implementing stage 4 load shedding due to the loss of capacity which included imports from Mozambique. “At this stage, it appears unlikely that the imports from Mozambique will be restored in the next few days, which we can now confirm was affected by the cyclone,” Eskom said. “The management of diesel and water resources is essential to ensure that the impact of the potential stage of load shedding in the week ahead can be reduced.” Stage 4 load shedding was announced on Saturday when Eskom said it would continue rotational load shedding to “build up necessary water reserves in the pump storage scheme”. Customers are advised to check load-shedding schedules on Eskom’s website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) and their municipal website. Eskom customers can contact 08600 37566. Cape Times
