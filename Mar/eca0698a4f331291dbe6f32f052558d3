Cape Town – A 38-year-old man was killed and a child injured outside a mosque in Hazendal, Athlone, on Friday. The incident occurred at 2pm on Friday and it’s alleged the shooting is gang-related. This on a day at least one gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 20 during Friday prayers at two New Zealand mosques in the country's worst-ever mass shooting, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemned as terrorism. Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel André Traut said of the Athlone incident: “The circumstances surrounding the death of a 38-year-old man are being investigated after he was shot and killed on Friday afternoon at about 2pm. "The suspect fled the scene and is yet to be arrested.” Traut added: "During the same incident, a child was caught in the crossfire and wounded. The child was admitted to hospital for treatment." A member of the Masjied Khaleel leadership, who asked not to be named, told TimesLIVE the congregation was praying when the shooting happened. "We just heard shots, and there were people running. This is how we live," he said. The deceased man was allegedly a well-known drug merchant who lived near the mosque. Cape Times
