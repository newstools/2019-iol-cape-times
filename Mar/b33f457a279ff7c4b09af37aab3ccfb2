Provincial education spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the geography classroom, and two consumer studies classrooms caught alight on Saturday night. “We do not know the cause of the fire. The damage has been reported to our Infrastructure directorate in terms of emergency maintenance. "The district will liaise with the school in terms of accommodating the learners when schools reopen,” Hammond said. Drakenstein Municipality spokesperson Riana Geldenhuys said two classrooms were gutted while a third classroom had smoke and water damage. “The municipality’s fire services division attended to the fire. The cause of the fire is being investigated by the police. "As the building has an asbestos roof, precautions have been put into place to ensure safe disposal,” she said. The Public Works Department was informed as well, Geldenhuys said. Cape Times
