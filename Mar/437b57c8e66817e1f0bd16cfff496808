Cape Town – A man in his twenties was very fortunate to have escaped with his life from a car accident near Plattekloof along the N1 on Friday morning. When paramedics and the emergency services arrived on the scene at 5am, they found a car that had been completely ripped open. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said the man was assessed and found to have only a broken leg and a few scrapes and bruises after he had wrapped his car around a pole. "The driver was still in his seat when paramedics arrived at the vehicle," said Vermaak. "Paramedics treated him on the scene and later transported him to a nearby hospital for further care," he added. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown.     A young man is lucky to have sustained only moderate injuries when his vehicle was ripped open during a collision on the #N1 near #PlattekloofRoad in #CapeTown this morning.
