The students were represented by Abdul Kariem Jacobs and Venice Burgins. Burgins said of the 22 students arrested on February 21, nine were released that day. He said at their first appearance, the case was postponed for further investigation. On Wednesday, the case was again postponed for a regional court date. “The reality of the case is the psychological trauma the students are undergoing,” Burgins said. ANC Youth League provincial chairperson Muhammed Khalid Sayed said it was disappointed the case had been postponed. Sayed said they would support the students. “The issue with us is that the students were not safe at the campus. We have raised the student’s concerns with the government,” he said. Last year, a student was found murdered in his hostel room and since then students have been concerned about crime at their campus. The students demonstrated with placards outside the Athlone campus along Klipfontein Road, demanding safer residences and transport. They marched to hand over their memorandum, which was signed by head of campus Theresa Bock. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
