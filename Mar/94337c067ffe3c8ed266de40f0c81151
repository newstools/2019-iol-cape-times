Cape Town - On Tuesday, March 12, NSRI Simonstown duty crew were activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following a request for medical assistance from a fishing trawler 16 nautical miles South of Cape Point. Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre had arranged for a Government Health EMS doctor to evaluate the patient's condition and it was suspected that the patient may be suffering a stroke. Darren Zimmerman, NSRI Simonstown station commander, said: "The sea rescue craft, Spirit of Safmarine III, was launched accompanied by a Cape Medical Response (CMR) paramedic team, SA Air Force (SAAF) 22 Squadron Oryx helicopter, accompanied by NSRI Airborne Sea Rescue (ASR) swimmers and WC Government Health EMS rescue paramedics." "On arrival on the scene, NSRI rescue swimmers were transferred from the sea rescue craft, Spirit of Safmarine III, onto the fishing trawler and the patient, in a stable and satisfactory condition, was transferred onto the sea rescue craft and in the care of the paramedics it was determined that the patient was stable enough to remain on the craft and not required to be airlifted into the Air Force helicopter." The patient, a 34-year-old fisherman, was brought to the NSRI Simonstown station and was then transported to hospital by CMR ambulance in a stable condition for further care. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
