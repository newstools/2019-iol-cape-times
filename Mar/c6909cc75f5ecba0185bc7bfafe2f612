Located in the Cape Winelands region of Klapmuts, the 30ha forms part of 253ha of land owned by the estate. The land will be the site for the newly planned Stellenbosch Smart City development. Rector and vice-chancellor Professor Wim de Villiers said: “This wonderful gesture is testament to the trust placed in the future of Maties as we enter our second century as a university.” He said Stellenbosch Wine and Country Estate chairperson and shareholder Jaap du Toit was instrumental in the donation: “It will help us to offer a transformative student experience.” Du Toit added: “The university is bursting at its seams on its Stellenbosch campus, and an innovation satellite node will make a wonderful contribution. "We believe that this donation will put the university on a path to establish a world-class node of innovation, which over time will also be able to serve more students.” SU and Innovus director Anita Nel said: “We aim to offer alternative space on the designated SU land for the start-ups outgrowing the space within the university’s launch lab business incubator.” Cape Times
