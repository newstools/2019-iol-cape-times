Cape Town – While judgment was reserved in the sentence appeal of a convicted Plettenberg Bay paedophile, child rights group Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA) said William Beale deserved to stay behind bars. Beale, a former computer engineer, was convicted in 2017 on 18 644 counts of possession of child pornography. The Thembalethu Regional Court had sentenced him to 15 years' direct imprisonment. Beale was arrested as part of Operation Cloud 9, a collaboration between South Africa and Belgian police. The investigation found Beale belonged to an international syndicate dealing with child porn. There were initially 107893 charges against Beale, but he had pleaded guilty to 18644, which the State had accepted. The State then withdrew the rest of the charges. He is appealing his sentence, and it was heard in the Western Cape High Court on Friday. WMACA spokesperson Joanne Barrett said some of the images found included the torture and murder of babies only a few days old. “We at WMACA trust that the high court will dismiss the appeal. This is not a victimless crime, as every image depicts a child being sexually abused, assaulted, raped and even murdered,” Barrett said. In sentencing proceedings, the State had argued that Beale's guilty plea did not conclude he had remorse. He didn’t ask for help for his “problem”, nor would have disclosed his criminal activities if not for his arrest. Cape Times
