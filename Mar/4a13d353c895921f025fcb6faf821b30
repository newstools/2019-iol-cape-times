Cape Town – A 39-year-old taxi driver has been shot and killed in Hout Bay following renewed taxi violence in the area. Ward councillor Roberto Miguel Quintas said in a statement on Wednesday: "Taxi operators in large numbers congregated on Main Road in the vicinity of the South African Police Service station in the early hours of Wednesday morning. "Approximately 40 gun shots were fired and one person has been shot. The taxi operators proceeded to blockade Valley Road Circle and Main Road on the Constantia Route.” Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said Constancia Road was closed following the shooting and police are monitoring the situation. According to operators, the shooting was triggered by tension between Hout Bay and Cape Town taxi operators over routes. A taxi operator who spoke to the SABC, who asked to remain anonymous, said Hout Bay operators are allegedly being permitted to transport passengers outside the area while their counterparts from Cape Town can only proceed as far as Camps Bay. Quintas said he had arranged for the Taxi Engagement Unit to facilitate the breaking up of blockades as well as a high-level meeting of all taxi stakeholders, City and provincial authorities is set to take place early next week at the Civic Centre.
