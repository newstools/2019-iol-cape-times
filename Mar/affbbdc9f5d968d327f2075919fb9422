Johannesburg - Slurs, insults, jabs. That was the twar between the ANC's Head of Elections Fikile Mbalula and ATM's NEC member Mzwanele Manyi. At one point the two belonged to one political home and were strong supporters of former president Jacob Zuma, but all decency went under the bus on Wednesday when Mbalula called Manyi a "Gupta slut". The two firebrands clashed after Manyi tweeted videos of Mbalula under cross-examination at the state capture inquiry.     The videos were aimed at "exposing" Mbalula for lying under oath, but the former ANC Youth League president wasn't having it.     Mbalula quickly put a jab into Manyi, accusing him of being a corrupt Gupta slut. Manyi took over the Guptas' media companies in 2017 in a vendor finance deal. The former cabinet spin doctor lost the TV channel when Multichoice cancelled their contract on 20 August 2018. Some Twitter users quickly went in to reprimand Mbalula but for the rest of Twitter-sphere it was a necessary laugh.         Political Bureau
