Van Gass came back to South Africa from England this month on what he described as a “double mission”; as part of the first disabled team to participate in the Absa Cape Epic race, and to share an inspirational story of triumph over tragedy, “From Paratrooper to Paralympian”, on April 2. His aim was to cycle throughout to make it to the finish line and depict the experience as hectic, but worth it. “It was such a challenge for me, but I loved every minute of the race. “At some point my body was just too tired, but I kept strong as I cycled through the beautiful scenery of Cape Town,” he said. The South African-born cyclist has been working with Legacy Education Alliance (LEA) for several years now, both in his role as Global Brand Ambassador and as a LEA student with his partner, Kathryn. The two are learning from LEA training and mentoring, and have developed a passion for property investing. Van Gass will attend Grant Smee’s Epic Networking event next month as a guest speaker and share his inspirational story. “I just hope it will make a difference in someone’s life,” he said. Cape Times
