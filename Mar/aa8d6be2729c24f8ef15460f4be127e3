Cape Town – Eskom will implement Stage 2 load shedding on Friday due to a shortage of capacity – the first time in almost a week it has not implemented Stage 4 – the power utility said. Stage 2 allows for 2 000MW to be load-shed on a rotational basis. In a statement issued on Thursday night, Eskom said Stage 2 load shedding would be implemented from 9am to 11pm on Friday. Load shedding shifted to Stage 1 from 11pm on Thursday until 9am on Friday, after another day of Stage 4 frustrations. With South Africans having become enveloped in doom and gloom over fears of possible Stage 5 and 6 load shedding, President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in Sharpeville on Thursday in his Human Rights Day speech, said he has put measures in place to ensure that the country comes out of the dark. “We will overcome this electricity crisis that is engulfing our country at this moment. We will overcome it just as we overcame the apartheid challenge,” he said. Ramaphosa said that access to electricity is a basic human right and urged all South Africans to join forces in bringing the crisis to an end.
