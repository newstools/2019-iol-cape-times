Van Gass, a retired member of the British Armed Forces Parachute Regiment, sustained life-changing injuries from a rocket-propelled grenade explosion during his second tour of Afghanistan in 2009. His injuries required 11 operations and intensive rehabilitation. Despite his loss of limbs, Van Gass’s resilience and mental and emotional tenacity gave him the strength to pursue his next life challenges to go on to become a leading international adventurer alongside Prince Harry at the North Pole. He was also a double gold medal winner at the Invictus Games and is now a valued member of the GB Paracycling team. “I am excited and honoured to be back in South Africa, participating in such an exciting and challenging race. "I will also be excited and to speak at the next Epic networking event on April 2. "I have been working with the Legacy Education Alliance (LEA) for a few years now, both in my role as global brand ambassador and also as an LEA student with my partner Kathryn. "We are both learning so much from LEA training and mentoring and have developed a passion for property investing,” he said. Van Gass said he hoped to bring home a medal from the Absa Cape Epic with his fellow team member, Stu Croxford. Welcoming him to South Africa, LEA country manager Peter Marthinusen said: “LEA is looking forward to welcoming a local hero as our guest speaker at Grant Smee’s Epic Networking event next month.” Cape Times
