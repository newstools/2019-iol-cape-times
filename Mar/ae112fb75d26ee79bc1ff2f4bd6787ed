Cape Town – The University of the Western Cape has declined an application by musician Mampintsha's company, West Ink Production, to use their stadium to host an event on May 4. This comes after a video surfaced on Monday in which Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo can be seen allegedly physically abusing his long-term girlfriend Bongekile Simelane, popularly known as Babes Wodumo. A charge of assault has been laid against Maphumulo. He appeared in court on Tuesday and is out on R2 000 bail. UWC said on Thursday: “The event application by West Ink Production to use the university’s sports stadium was under consideration by the relevant structures on campus. “However, developments at the weekend have put the application in a different light. A charge of assault has been laid against Mampintsha. “While the university respects due process and the rule of law, it cannot in good conscience allow an event to take place on its campus involving an individual who has been implicated in an incident of gender-based violence."
