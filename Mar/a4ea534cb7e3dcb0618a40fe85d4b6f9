The company’s employees at Blue Ribbon bread in Salt River have been on a protected strike since November. This has forced Premier to transfer employees from its other bakeries across the country and to use temporary workers. Food and Allied Workers’ Union (Fawu) general secretary Katishi Masemola said: “On Thursday we had entered the 100th day of this legally-protected strike. The company has a right to employ other people, but when the strike officially ends all those workers affiliated to Fawu will return. Their jobs are guaranteed. We encourage workers to not use violence. “The strike was prolonged by the employer’s demands that seek to reverse gains that exist and were made some decades ago by workers. “The company wants to reduce Sunday overtime or do away with paid transport allowance and lunch-hour. They also wanted to introduce an unhealthy 12-hour shift system and monthly 195 hours of work to avoid paying overtime on weekends and weekdays.” Cape Times
