Cape Town – A suspected drug dealer alleged to have been on his way to deliver Ritalin tablets to a southern suburbs school was arrested on Wednesday. City of Cape Town Metro Police Department spokesperson Sergeant Ruth Solomons said officers from the property crimes unit arrested a 22-year-old man in Athlone after receiving a tip-off. "The Metro Police Property Crimes Unit arrested a suspect today for possession of schedule six prescription drugs. Officers intercepted the 22-year-old in Athlone after receiving a tip-off," Solomons said. "He was in possession of eight Ritalin tablets and couldn't provide a medical script for the drugs. It's believed the suspect was heading to a school in the southern suburbs to deliver the drugs to a client. "Officers found further orders via texts on his cellphone. The Metro Police Department urges parents to be vigilant as it appears that the drug is gaining popularity among learners." Methylphenidate, sold under the trade names Ritalin among others, is a stimulant medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, and helps people studying to focus.
