Sactwu’s national demands follow on its national wage mandating meeting held from March 7 to 9 in Durban, where 160 shop stewards consolidated the decision. Sactwu general secretary André Kriel said members’ demands were submitted to employers in the footwear, tanning, general goods and handbags, sheltered employment enterprises and distribution retail sectors between last Thursday and Monday. “Our demands include an average of 15% wage increase, improvements in employer retirement fund contributions, a 40-hour work week without loss of pay, local procurement promotion and stronger organisational rights, such as improved paid time off for shop steward trade union duties, and the permanent employment of all contract workers,” he said. Kriel said most of the wage increases for the sectors Sactwu negotiated with were due between next month and July. Negotiations are expected to commence with effect from the end of March. Cape Times
