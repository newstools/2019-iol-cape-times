Of the seven, three arrests by the Rail Enforcement Unit (REU) were for alleged possession of drugs and stolen property in Pinelands, Bishop Lavis and the CBD. These took place during the REU’s conducting of 2029 stop-and-search operations and its issuing of fines to the value of R76 950. The other four arrests, by Prasa Protection Services, the SAPS Rapid Rail Response Unit and private security contractors, were in terms of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act. Confiscated items include scissors, knives, hacksaws, blades, illegal substances, stolen property and council poles, with some arrests for holding train doors open while in transit. Metrorail Western Cape regional manager Richard Walker said: “We’ve seen Uber, minibus taxis and buses increasingly targeted by criminals. “It’s unacceptable that commuters should be at risk. This is why collaboration between law enforcement agencies is essential. “Commuter reports of increased use of dangerous drugs like mandrax and whoonga pipes on board help law enforcement to deploy resources to curb this practice.” Cape Times
