Some South Africans witnessed how a single letter was able to move the president. Daisy Ngedla from East London was seeking answers from Ramaphosa and her sincerity persuaded him to respond to her. He responded to her letter, explaining that she could be president some day. He also visited her school. IPYG on Thursday delivered letters written by primary school children to Ramaphosa. They wrote about how they feared violence in their communities. “Dear Mr President, why is the world shooting?” a primary school pupil from Mitchells Plain wrote in his letter. Last year, about one million citizens from 176 countries wrote peace letters to their presidents. The goal for this year is to deliver peace letters to the presidents of 193 countries. The spirit of the campaign is based on the values written in the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW). IPYG will host the third annual commemoration of the proclamation of the DPCW at the Centre for the Book tomorrow. The topic for the event is “the role of women and the youth for strengthening peace-building in South Africa”. Participants from across the City will join the Peace Letter Campaign at this event. Their letters will be also sent to Ramaphosa. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
